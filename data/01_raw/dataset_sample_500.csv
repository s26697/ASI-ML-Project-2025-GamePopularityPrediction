Certain ideas that were postponed or cancelled might also be found in the T.T.S. as a result. - You need to own a version of the game (Standard, Gold, Complete or Starter Edition) to unlock this product - The TTS will only function during specific timeframes.

4000;Garry's Mod;29.11.2006;0;5.99;0;"Garry's Mod is a physics sandbox. There aren't any predefined aims or goals. We give you the tools and leave you to play. You spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions - whether that's a car, a rocket, a catapult or something that doesn't have a name yet - that's up to you. You can do it offline, or join the thousands of players who play online each day. If you're not too great at construction - don't worry! You can place a variety of characters in silly positions. But if you want to do more, we have the means. Beyond the Sandbox The Garry's Mod community is a tremendous source of content and has added hundreds of unique modes to the game. In Trouble In Terrorist Town, you can be a detective solving an online murder as criminals attempt to cover up their homicides. Be a ball, a plant, a chair, or anything else in Prop Hunt's elaborate, shape-shifting game of Hide &amp; Seek. Elevator: Source is gaming's first elevator thrill ride, delivering players to airlocks and kitten dance parties. We have one of the most vibrant Steam Community Workshops, with over 300'000 models, maps, and contraptions to download. It has everything from new tools to improve your builds, to guns that fire rainbow-tinged nuclear blasts from space. Take as much or as little as you need: it‚Äôs all free. Please note: Some multiplayer servers and game-modes might require you to own other games - such as Counter-Strike: Source and Team Fortress 2. ";"Garry's Mod is a physics sandbox. There aren't any predefined aims or goals. We give you the tools and leave you to play. You spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions - whether that's a car, a rocket, a catapult or something that doesn't have a name yet - that's up to you. You can do it offline, or join the thousands of players who play online each day. If you're not too great at construction - don't worry! You can place a variety of characters in silly positions. But if you want to do more, we have the means. Beyond the Sandbox The Garry's Mod community is a tremendous source of content and has added hundreds of unique modes to the game. In Trouble In Terrorist Town, you can be a detective solving an online murder as criminals attempt to cover up their homicides. Be a ball, a plant, a chair, or anything else in Prop Hunt's elaborate, shape-shifting game of Hide &amp; Seek. Elevator: Source is gaming's first elevator thrill ride, delivering players to airlocks and kitten dance parties.

Take on the most important contract of your life: to track down the child of prophecy, the key to saving or destroying this world. ‚Ä¢ In times of war, chase down the child of prophecy, a living weapon foretold by ancient elven legends. ‚Ä¢ Struggle against ferocious rulers, spirits of the wilds, and even a threat from beyond the veil ‚Äì all hell-bent on controlling this world. ‚Ä¢ Define your destiny in a world that may not be worth saving. ";You are Geralt of Rivia, mercenary monster slayer. Before you stands a war-torn, monster-infested continent you can explore at will. Your current contract? Tracking down Ciri ‚Äî the Child of Prophecy, a living weapon that can alter the shape of the world.;‚ÄúONE OF THE BEST GAMES EVER MADE‚Äù 10/10 ‚Äì GameSpot ‚ÄúAMAZING‚Äù 9.3/10 ‚Äì IGN ‚ÄúONE OF THE BEST RPGs EVER MADE‚Äù 9.8/10 ‚Äì Game Trailers ;https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/292030/header.jpg?t=1736424367;https://www.thewitcher.com/witcher3;http://en.cdprojektred.com/support;http://en.cdprojektred.com/contact-support/;PRAWDA;FA£SZ;FA£SZ;93;https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f;78;761658;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt contains strong language, intense violence, blood and gore, as well as nudity and sexual material. ;['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish -

From a 3rd person perspective, players use a variety of weapons (pistols, machine guns, flamethrowers) and stratagems (turrets, airstrikes, etc.) to shoot and kill the alien threats.

Kennedy, Jill Valentine. OVERVIEW About the Game Death Is Not an Escape. Trapped forever in a realm of eldritch evil where even death is not an escape, four determined Survivors face a bloodthirsty Killer in a vicious game of nerve and wits. Pick a side and step into a world of tension and terror with horror gaming's best asymmetrical multiplayer. Survivors play in third-person and have the advantage of better situational awareness. The Killer plays in first-person and is more focused on their prey. The Survivors' goal in each encounter is to escape the Killing Ground without getting caught by the Killer - something that sounds easier than it is, especially when the environment changes every time you play. Key Features ‚Ä¢ Survive Together‚Ä¶ Or Not - Survivors can either cooperate with the others or be selfish. Your chance of survival will vary depending on whether you work together as a team or if you go at it alone. Will you be able to outwit the Killer and escape their Killing Ground? ‚Ä¢ Where Am I? - Each level is procedurally generated, so you‚Äôll never know what to expect. Random spawn points mean you will never feel safe as the world and its danger change every time you play. ‚Ä¢ A Feast for Killers - Dead by Daylight draws from all corners of the horror world. As a Killer you can play as anything from a powerful Slasher to terrifying paranormal entities. Familiarize yourself with your Killing Grounds and master each Killer‚Äôs unique power to be able to hunt, catch and sacrifice your victims. ‚Ä¢ Deeper and Deeper - Each Killer and Survivor has their own deep progression system and plenty of unlockables that can be customized to fit your own personal strategy. Experience, skills and understanding of the environment are key to being able to hunt or outwit the Killer. ‚Ä¢ Real People, Real Fear - The procedural levels and real human reactions to pure horror makes each game session an unexpected scenario. You will never be able to tell how it‚Äôs going to turn out. Ambience, music, and chilling environments combine into a terrifying experience. With enough time, you might even discover what‚Äôs hiding in the fog. WARNING: PHOTOSENSITIVITY/EPILEPSY SEIZURES - READ THIS NOTICE BEFORE PLAYING A very small percentage of people may experience epileptic seizures or blackouts when exposed to certain kinds of flashing lights or light patterns. These persons, or even people who have no history of seizures or epilepsy, may experience epileptic symptoms or seizures while playing video games. If you or any of your relatives has an epileptic condition or has had seizures of any kind, consult your physician before playing any video game. IMMEDIATELY DISCONTINUE use and consult a physician if you or your child experience any of the following symptoms: dizziness, altered vision, eye or muscle twitching, involuntary movements, loss of awareness, disorientation, or convulsions. Parents should watch for or ask their children about the above symptoms. You may reduce risk of photosensitive epileptic seizures by taking the following precautions: sit farther from the screen, use a smaller screen, play in a well-lit room, do not play when you are drowsy or fatigued.

For immersion you can pick a frequency and use two-way radios to communicate with your squad rather than external voice chat programs. ;You're a survivor in the zombie infested ruins of society, and must work with your friends and forge alliances to remain among the living.;;https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/304930/header.jpg?t=1734630748;http://smartlydressedgames.com/;https://support.smartlydressedgames.com/hc/en-us;;PRAWDA;PRAWDA;PRAWDA;0;;77;7597;;['English'];[];[{'title': 'Buy Unturned', 'description': '', 'subs': [{'text': 'Unturned - Commercial License (Free) - Free', 'description': '', 'price': 0.0}]}];['Smartly Dressed Games'];['Smartly Dressed Games'];['Single-player', 'Multi-player', 'PvP', 'Online PvP', 'LAN PvP', 'Co-op', 'Online Co-op', 'LAN Co-op', 'Steam Achievements', 'Steam Trading Cards', 'Steam Workshop', 'In-App Purchases', 'Steam Cloud', 'Valve Anti-Cheat enabled', 'Stats', 'Includes level editor', 'Remote Play on Tablet'];['Action', 'Adventure', 'Casual', 'Indie', 'Free To Play'];['https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/304930/ss_a2d8ffa4eaff717539c1fd9d3cd0440691c6fc81.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734630748', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/304930/ss_b1cf12ba306180da433dcf199f6f4a2fa74e48bd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734630748', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/304930/ss_e7bd3004478e0e4500521be44995488933f70435.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734630748', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/304930/ss_de07d47b7f81d0f53100398369ac49803d0570bf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734630748', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/304930/ss_c5853bdc47a4d84fc1f3e419be99bed787979725.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734630748', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/304930/ss_f634649eb2a50b49bc98f7cc27314b671c8cbff5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734630748', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/304930/ss_b4c970fade045cdb787b7dffb59928d6bd91d156.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734630748', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/304930/ss_c45658331fd2c4b6a8e09b50bbadcc91c5801b36.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734630748', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/304930/ss_89f92e7881cddaaf787a42c47ba7d666c01158f8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734630748', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/304930/ss_e9b5d9c8b1afc2aabd3e33ac9407a09bd9bffccb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734630748'];['http://video.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_trailers/256688960/movie_max.mp4?t=1688148646', 'http://video.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_trailers/256688950/movie_max.mp4?t=1688148651', 'http://video.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_trailers/256668933/movie_max.mp4?t=1688148658'];0;;504673;48084;50000000 - 100000000;0;0;0;0;0;13530;{'Free to Play': 36916, 'Survival': 16566, 'Zombies': 15340, 'Multiplayer': 15196, 'Open World': 15092, 'Co-op': 14965, 'Sandbox': 14918, 'Crafting': 14905, 'Shooter': 14896, 'Adventure': 14866, 'Post-apocalyptic': 14859, 'First-Person': 14847, 'Singleplayer': 14834, 'Looter Shooter': 14833, 'FPS': 14830, 'Action': 14826, 'Massively Multiplayer': 14797, 'Indie': 14769, 'Atmospheric': 14761, 'Casual': 14758};91;552875;67;2556
346110;ARK: Survival Evolved;27.08.2017;0;14.99;15;"ARK: Survival Ascended! Respawn into a new dinosaur survival experience beyond your wildest dreams‚Ä¶ as ARK is reimagined from the ground-up into the next-generation of videogame technology with Unreal Engine 5! You awake on a mysterious island, your senses overwhelmed by the blinding sunlight and brilliant colors bouncing off every surface around you, the azure waters of a verdant Island lapping at your bare feet. A deep roar echoes from the misty jungle, jolting you into action, and you stand up ‚Äì not afraid, but intrigued. Are you ready to form a tribe, tame and breed hundreds of species of dinosaurs and other primeval creatures, explore, craft, build, and fight your way to the top of the food-chain? Your new world awaits‚Ä¶ step through the looking-glass and join it! ARK: Genesis Part Two! Your quest for ultimate survival is now complete with the launch of ARK: Genesis Part 2! Survivors will conclude the ARK storyline while adventuring through exotic new worlds with all-new mission-based gameplay. Discover, utilize and master new creatures, new craftable items, weapons, and structures unlike anything you have seen yet! The saga is now complete, and hundreds of hours of new story-oriented ARK gameplay await you! Purchased as part of the ARK: Genesis Season Pass you gain access to two new huge story-oriented expansion packs -- Genesis Part 1 and Genesis Part 2 (new!) -- as well as a 'Noglin' Chibi cosmetic, a ‚ÄòShadowmane‚Äô Chibi cosmetic, a new cosmetic armor set, and an in-game, artificially intelligent companion called ‚ÄòHLN-A‚Äô who can scan additional hidden Explorer Notes found throughout the other ARKs. Features the voiceover talent of David Tennant (Doctor Who, Good Omens) playing the villainous Sir Edmund Rockwell, and Madeleine Madden (The Wheel of Time, Picnic at Hanging Rock, Dora and the Lost City of Gold) as in-game robotic AI companion HLN-A/Helena Walker. About the Game As a man or woman stranded naked, freezing and starving on the shores of a mysterious island called ARK, you must hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to withstand the elements. Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame &amp; breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape! Dinosaurs, Creatures, &amp; Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&amp;-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you‚Äôve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator &amp; prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies! You must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants &amp; meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing &amp; armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage &amp; extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system! By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing &amp; armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style. Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians &amp; vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner! By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK‚Äôs god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated. Create a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village! All items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new 'Engrams' to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you'll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D 'Explorer Notes'. By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose! Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted &amp; stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames! The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you‚Äôll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text &amp; voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct &amp; draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray... And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned. On the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK's by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique 'Procedurally Generated ARKs', for infinite replayability and endless surprises. You can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game, with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example. Host your own server and configure your ARK precisely to your liking. We want to see what you create! The over-the-top hyper real imagery of the ARK its creatures is brought to expressive life using a highly-customized Unreal Engine 4, with fully dynamic lighting &amp; global illumination, weather systems (rain, fog, snow, etc) &amp; true-to-life volumetric cloud simulation, and the latest in advanced DirectX11 and DirectX12 rendering techniques.

218620;PAYDAY 2;13.08.2013;18;9.99;78;PAYDAY 2 is an action-packed, four-player co-op shooter that once again lets gamers don the masks of the original PAYDAY crew - Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains - as they descend on Washington DC for an epic crime spree. The CRIMENET network offers a huge range of dynamic contracts, and players are free to choose anything from small-time convenience store hits or kidnappings, to big league cyber-crime or emptying out major bank vaults for that epic PAYDAY. While in DC, why not participate in the local community, and run a few political errands? Up to four friends co-operate on the hits, and as the crew progresses the jobs become bigger, better and more rewarding. Along with earning more money and becoming a legendary criminal comes a character customization and crafting system that lets crews build and customize their own guns and gear. Key Features Rob Banks, Get Paid ‚Äì Players must choose their crew carefully, because when the job goes down they will need the right mix of skills on their side. CRIMENET ‚Äì The dynamic contract database lets gamers pick and choose from available jobs by connecting with local contacts such as Vlad the Ukrainian, shady politician 'The Elephant', and South American drug trafficker Hector, all with their own agenda and best interests in mind. PAYDAY Gunplay and Mechanics on a New Level ‚Äì Firing weapons and zip tying civilians never felt so good. Dynamic Scenarios ‚Äì No heist ever plays out the same way twice. Every single scenario has random geometry or even rare events. Choose Your Skills ‚Äì As players progress they can invest in any of five special Skill Trees: Mastermind, Enforcer, Ghost, Technician and Fugitive. Each features a deep customization tree of associated skills and equipment to master, and they can be mixed and matched to create the ultimate heister. More Masks than Ever ‚Äì PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving players the ability to craft their own unique mask with a pattern and color of their choice, resulting in millions of different combinations. Weapons and Modifications ‚Äì A brand new arsenal for the serious heister, covering everything from sniper and assault rifles to compact PDWs and SMGs. Once you've settled for a favorite, you can modify it with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks and more, all of which will affect the performance of your weapon. There are also purely aesthetic enhancements - why not go for the drug lord look with polished walnut grips for your nine? Play It Your Way ‚Äì Each job allows for multiple approaches, such as slow and stealthy ambushes or running in guns blazing. Hit the target any way you want, each approach will provide a different experience. A Long History of Additional Content ‚Äì More than 70 updates since release, including new heists, characters, weapons and other gameplay features like driving cars and forklifts. ;PAYDAY 2 is an action-packed, four-player co-op shooter that once again lets gamers don the masks of the original PAYDAY crew - Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains - as they descend on Washington DC for an epic crime spree. The CRIMENET network offers a huge range of dynamic contracts, and players are free to choose anything from small-time convenience store hits or kidnappings, to big league cyber-crime or emptying out major bank vaults for that epic PAYDAY. While in DC, why not participate in the local community, and run a few political errands? Up to four friends co-operate on the hits, and as the crew progresses the jobs become bigger, better and more rewarding. Along with earning more money and becoming a legendary criminal comes a character customization and crafting system that lets crews build and customize their own guns and gear. Key Features Rob Banks, Get Paid ‚Äì Players must choose their crew carefully, because when the job goes down they will need the right mix of skills on their side. CRIMENET ‚Äì The dynamic contract database lets gamers pick and choose from available jobs by connecting with local contacts such as Vlad the Ukrainian, shady politician 'The Elephant', and South American drug trafficker Hector, all with their own agenda and best interests in mind. PAYDAY Gunplay and Mechanics on a New Level ‚Äì Firing weapons and zip tying civilians never felt so good. Dynamic Scenarios ‚Äì No heist ever plays out the same way twice. Every single scenario has random geometry or even rare events. Choose Your Skills ‚Äì As players progress they can invest in any of five special Skill Trees: Mastermind, Enforcer, Ghost, Technician and Fugitive. Each features a deep customization tree of associated skills and equipment to master, and they can be mixed and matched to create the ultimate heister. More Masks than Ever ‚Äì PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving players the ability to craft their own unique mask with a pattern and color of their choice, resulting in millions of different combinations. Weapons and Modifications ‚Äì A brand new arsenal for the serious heister, covering everything from sniper and assault rifles to compact PDWs and SMGs. Once you've settled for a favorite, you can modify it with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks and more, all of which will affect the performance of your weapon. There are also purely aesthetic enhancements - why not go for the drug lord look with polished walnut grips for your nine?

1623730;Palworld;18.01.2024;0;22.49;1;"Q. What kind of game is this? A. In this game, you can peacefully live alongside mysterious creatures known as Pals or risk your life to drive off a ruthless poaching syndicate. Pals can be used to fight, or they can be made to work on farms or factories. You can even sell them or eat them! Survival In a harsh environment where food is scarce and vicious poachers roam, danger waits around every corner. To survive, you must tread carefully and make difficult choices...even if that means eating your own Pals when the time comes. Mounts &amp; Exploration Pals can be mounted to traverse the land, sea and sky‚Äîallowing you to traverse all kinds of environment as you explore the world. Building Structures Want to build a pyramid? Put an army of Pals on the job. Don't worry; there are no labor laws for Pals. Production Make use of Pals and their skills to make fire, generate electricity, or mine ore so that you can live a life of comfort. Farming Some Pals are good at planting seeds, while others are skilled at watering or harvesting crops. Work together with your Pals to create an idyllic farmstead. Factories &amp; Automation Letting Pals do the work is the key to automation. Build a factory, place a Pal in it, and they'll keep working as long as they're fed‚Äîuntil they're dead, that is. Dungeon Exploration With Pals on your side you can tackle even the most dangerous areas. When the time comes, you might have to sacrifice one to save your skin. They'll protect your life‚Äîeven if it costs their own. Breeding &amp; Genetics Breed a Pal and it will inherit the characteristics of its parents. Combine rare pals to create the strongest Pal of them all! Poaching &amp; Crime Endangered Pals live in wildlife sanctuaries. Sneak in and capture rare Pals to get rich quick! It's not a crime if you don't get caught, after all. Multiplayer Multiplayer is supported, so invite a friend and go on an adventure together! And of course you can battle your friends and trade Pals, too. In online co-op play mode, up to 4 players can play together. Additionally, a dedicated server can allow up to 32 players to play together. ";"Q. What kind of game is this? A.

1172620;Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition;03.06.2020;0;39.99;5;New This Season In a new Season focused on a wealth of wildlife, who better to lead the charge than The Hunter‚Äôs Call? It‚Äôs a time of expanded operations for everyone‚Äôs favourite fishing family, installing new stations at the Outposts and commissioning Voyages for pirates to help tackle the rise of these wild beasts.¬† New kinds of Megalodon, unique Treasured Fish and even wild boars have been spied throughout the Sea of Thieves, promising rich rewards for the hunter cunning enough to best them.¬† Reputation Rising The Hunter‚Äôs Call are stepping up: pirates will now be able to continue earning reputation through five levels of Distinction, enabling them to progress far past what was previously possible with this Trading Company. A range of new Company-specific loot also provides a fresh incentive for rising through the ranks‚Ä¶¬† Represent the Company Truly dedicated hunters can now risk their lives and their loot in service to the Company as an Emissary! As with other Trading Companies, flying an Emissary Flag will guarantee increased rewards for any loot you turn in, but also makes you a target for any other pirates in the area looking to pick a fight. Fishing and Raid Voyages Many hunters are happy to go wherever the wind takes them, but The Hunter‚Äôs Call are offering a little more direction to those who want it. New Fishing and Raid Voyages will be made available as pirates rank up with the Company, promising a range of rewards for successfully completed missions.¬† You‚Äôre Going to Need¬†a Bigger Galleon The familiar Megalodons of the Sea of Thieves are fearsome beasts, but it turns out that even darker creatures have been dwelling beneath the waves‚Ä¶ The Feared Redmaw and Barnacled Dread have crossed over from the Sea of the Damned, and now lie in wait to terrorise sailors with their ferocity and alarming special abilities.¬† Crews attacked by the Feared Redmaw will need to ensure they‚Äôve got plenty of water ready to put out her fires, while those facing down the Barnacled Dread should watch for Ocean Crawlers boarding their ship to upset the odds. Hunter‚Äôs Call Grade 5 Emissaries will at least have an advantage in being able to spot these emergent new Megalodon threats on their ship‚Äôs map!¬† New Seasonal Rewards A new Season means a brand new set of rewards, unlocked by climbing through 100 levels of Renown! Earn cosmetics, gold, Doubloons and even Ancient Coins as you rise through the ranks by living the pirate life.¬† About the Game Sea of Thieves offers the essential pirate experience, from sailing and fighting to exploring and looting ‚Äì everything you need to live the pirate life and become a legend in your own right.

About the Game Welcome to a new world! Take on the role of a hunter and slay ferocious monsters in a living, breathing ecosystem where you can use the landscape and its diverse inhabitants to get the upper hand. Hunt alone or in co-op with up to three other players, and use materials collected from fallen foes to craft new gear and take on even bigger, badder beasts! INTRODUCTION Overview Battle gigantic monsters in epic locales. As a hunter, you'll take on quests to hunt monsters in a variety of habitats. Take down these monsters and receive materials that you can use to create stronger weapons and armor in order to hunt even more dangerous monsters. In Monster Hunter: World, the latest installment in the series, you can enjoy the ultimate hunting experience, using everything at your disposal to hunt monsters in a new world teeming with surprises and excitement. Setting Once every decade, elder dragons trek across the sea to travel to the land known as the New World in a migration referred to as the Elder Crossing. To get to the bottom of this mysterious phenomenon, the Guild has formed the Research Commission, dispatching them in large fleets to the New World. As the Commission sends its Fifth Fleet in pursuit of the colossal elder dragon, Zorah Magdaros, one hunter is about to embark on a journey grander than anything they could have ever imagined. ECOSYSTEM A World That Breathes Life There are various locations teeming with wildlife. Expeditions into these locales are bound to turn up interesting discoveries. HUNTING A Diverse Arsenal, and an Indispensable Partner Your equipment will give you the power to need to carve out a place for yourself in the New World. The Hunter's Arsenal There are fourteen different weapons at the hunter's disposal, each with its own unique characteristics and attacks. Many hunters acquire proficiency in multiple types, while others prefer to attain mastery of one. Scoutflies Monster tracks, such as footprints and gashes, dot each locale. Your Scoutflies will remember the scent of a monster and guide you to other nearby tracks. And as you gather more tracks, the Scoutflies will give you even more information. Slinger The Slinger is an indispensable tool for a hunter, allowing you to arm yourself with stones and nuts that can be gathered from each locale. From diversion tactics to creating shortcuts, the Slinger has a variety of uses, and allows you to hunt in new and interesting ways. Specialized Tools Specialized tools activate powerful effects for a limited amount of time, and up to two can be equipped at a time. Simple to use, they can be selected and activated just like any other item you take out on a hunt. Palicoes Palicoes are hunters' reliable comrades out in the field, specialized in a variety of offensive, defensive, and restorative support abilities. The hunter's Palico joins the Fifth Fleet with pride, as much a bona fide member of the Commission as any other hunter. ;Welcome to a new world!

Dive Into a Vast Underwater World You have crash-landed on an alien ocean world, and the only way to go is down. Subnautica's oceans range from sun drenched shallow coral reefs to treacherous deep-sea trenches, lava fields, and bio-luminescent underwater rivers. Manage your oxygen supply as you explore kelp forests, plateaus, reefs, and winding cave systems. The water teems with life: Some of it helpful, much of it harmful. Scavenge, Craft, and Survive After crash landing in your Life Pod, the clock is ticking to find water, food, and to develop the equipment you need to explore. Collect resources from the ocean around you. Craft diving gear, lights, habitat modules, and submersibles. Venture deeper and further form to find rarer resources, allowing you to craft more advanced items. Construct Underwater Habitats Build bases on the sea floor. Choose layouts and components, and manage hull-integrity as depth and pressure increase. Use your base to store resources, park vehicles, and replenish oxygen supplies as you explore the vast ocean. Unravel the Mystery What happened to this planet? Signs abound that something is not right. What caused you to crash? What is infecting the sea life? Who built the mysterious structures scattered around the ocean? Can you find a way to make it off the planet alive? Disrupt the Food Chain The ocean teems with life: Use the ecosystem to help you. Lure and distract a threatening creature with a fresh fish, or simply swim as fast as you can to avoid gnashing jaws of roaming predators. Handle the Pressure Build a Pressure Re-Active Waterproof Nanosuit, or PRAWN Suit, and explore extreme depth and heat. Modify the suit with mining drills, torpedo launchers, propulsion cannons, grappling hooks and more. Fear the Night As the sun goes down, the predators come out. The ocean is unforgiving of those caught unprepared in the darkness. Areas that are safe to explore during the day become treacherous at night, but also reveal a beauty that those who hide from the darkness will never see. Dive Below the Ocean Floor Cave systems wind below the sea bed, from dark claustrophobic passages to caverns lit by bio-luminescent life and burning-hot lava flows. Explore the world below the ocean floor, but watch your oxygen levels, and take care to avoid the threats lurking in the darkness. About the Development Team Subnautica is being created by Unknown Worlds, a small studio founded by Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire that traces its roots back to the 2003 Half-Life mod Natural Selection. The team is scattered around the globe, from the United States to the United Kingdom, France, the Czech Republic, Russia, Thailand, Australia, and many more places. There is a central office in San Francisco, California that serves as home base for the whole team.

This game is for people who enjoy throwing around ragdolls but want it to be more detailed, satisfying, and feel more free while doing so. Ragdolls are simple on the outside but detailed on the inside. You can siphon their blood and replace it with nitroglycerine. You can submerge their head and cause brain damage by asphyxiation. Think of something horrible, and you can probably do it in People Playground. Afterwards, you could even hook them up to an ECG and blood supply to try to get them back on their feet. Every object in the game has its own physical properties: weight, sharpness, thermal and electrical conductivity, ferromagnetism, heat capacity, bullet resistance, and so on. The game simulates temperature, heat transfer through objects and through the air, electricity, and rigid body dynamics. All these systems combined make for emergent gameplay. You may experience behaviour that was never explicitly implemented. Mutilation aside, you are encouraged to build interesting contraptions or download them from the Steam Workshop. Construct airplanes, walkers, impenetrable bases, automatic doors, shields, computers, unholy weaponry - it's up to you! Once you get bored of the limited amount of items, you may download one of many Workshop mods and addons to expand the toy box, or you could make your own.;Shoot, stab, burn, poison, tear, vaporise, or crush ragdolls.

Spend your afternoon dogfighting in fighter jets, before winding down in a treehouse that exists floating in a nebula. Make a new best friend while exploring a haunted mansion, right before playing a hand of cards with a robot, alien, and eight-foot tall wolf. In VRChat, there are hundreds of thousands of worlds, millions of avatars ‚Äì all created by the users . No matter what you‚Äôre into, there‚Äôs a space in VRChat for you. And if there isn‚Äôt, we‚Äôll give you the tools to make your dream a reality. While not required to join in on the fun, VRChat was built to take advantage of VR headsets in many unique ways. That means avatars that flow with your movement, and systems that work alongside various hardware platforms to provide full-body tracking, finger tracking, and much, much more. There‚Äôs something magical around every corner. Come take a look, and see what you find. In VRChat, there‚Äôs always something to do ‚Äì and people to meet there. Visit a planetarium and have a chat about astronomy. Go on a virtual hike through a majestic fantasy forest. Pull up to a car meet, and talk shop with some gearheads. Attend a live music event underneath a chemical storage facility, and talk obscure genres with DJs. Once you find your crowd, join their Group, and you'll be able to find them again the next time you're on. Your community ‚Äì whatever it is ‚Äì is here. There are thousands of games to play in VRChat. Try running a kitchen in a busy restaurant, or racing go-karts in zero gravity. Fancy a battle royale? We‚Äôve got those, too -- just probably with a wider diversity of avatars than you‚Äôve ever seen before. It doesn‚Äôt matter what you like to play: casual card games, shooters, racing, platformers, puzzles, horror, and of course, endless party games. If you want to play it, it probably exists here (and if it doesn't, you can build it yourself). Everything here was built by the community using the VRChat SDK. Combined with Unity and Udon, our in-house scripting language, we give our users as much power as possible to build whatever their imaginations can conjure up. But creation isn‚Äôt just limited to worlds. VRChat provides a level of creative freedom that is unmatched anywhere else, and nowhere is that reflected best than on the avatars of our users. In VRChat, you can be anything, and explore your identity however you‚Äôd like. Want to be an alien? A talking dog? A sentient shoe with glowing bits that react to the beat of music by changing color? I mean, sure, if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre about. Come on in -- hundreds of thousands of worlds (and a whole bunch of new friends!) are waiting for you. ;Imagine a space filled with limitless possibilities.

We‚Äôve got those, too -- just probably with a wider diversity of avatars than you‚Äôve ever seen before. It doesn‚Äôt matter what you like to play: casual card games, shooters, racing, platformers, puzzles, horror, and of course, endless party games. If you want to play it, it probably exists here (and if it doesn't, you can build it yourself). Everything here was built by the community using the VRChat SDK. Combined with Unity and Udon, our in-house scripting language, we give our users as much power as possible to build whatever their imaginations can conjure up. But creation isn‚Äôt just limited to worlds. VRChat provides a level of creative freedom that is unmatched anywhere else, and nowhere is that reflected best than on the avatars of our users. In VRChat, you can be anything, and explore your identity however you‚Äôd like. Want to be an alien? A talking dog? A sentient shoe with glowing bits that react to the beat of music by changing color? I mean, sure, if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre about. Come on in -- hundreds of thousands of worlds (and a whole bunch of new friends!) are waiting for you. ;Join our growing community as you explore, play, and help craft the future of social VR. Create worlds and custom avatars.

238960;Path of Exile;23.10.2013;0;0.0;0;You are an Exile, struggling to survive on the dark continent of Wraeclast, as you fight to earn power that will allow you to exact your revenge against those who wronged you. Created by hardcore gamers, Path of Exile is an online Action RPG set in a dark fantasy world. With a focus on visceral action combat, powerful items and deep character customization, Path of Exile is completely free and will never be pay-to-win. Key Features Freedom. Power. Revenge. Path of Exile is an online Action RPG designed around a strong online item economy and deep character customisation. Path of Exile is set in the dark fantasy world of Wraeclast. Scarred by mysterious catastrophes of the past and inhabited by creatures of nightmare, the very environment challenges exiles who dare explore it. You play as the Duelist, Witch, Ranger, Templar, Marauder, Shadow or the Scion class. From forsaken shores through to the city of Oriath, explore Wraeclast and uncover the ancient secrets waiting for you. Unlimited Character Customization Create and customise hundreds of unique skill combinations from tradable itemised gems and our gigantic Passive Skill Tree. Combine skill gems, support gems and trigger gems to create your own unique combination of power, defence and destruction. All of Path of Exile's character classes share its vast Passive Skill Tree. Starting at one of seven distinct locations dictated by their chosen class, players can focus on the core specialities of their class or travel across the tree to build complex combinations of skills from various disciplines. Scattered across the tree are Keystone passives, Masteries and Jewel Sockets that drastically alter the way a character is played. Armed to Kill Path of Exile is completely designed around items. Our flasks are persistent items that have mods. Our endgame areas can be found as Map items that have mods altering their challenges and rewards. We've gone as far as removing gold as a currency and basing our trade economy around orbs that can randomly reroll the properties of other items. We have carefully constructed our item system for veterans of the best Action RPGs. Explore the Atlas of Worlds The Atlas of Worlds is a series of more than a hundred high-level maps that truly test the limits of your build. As you explore the Atlas, you will eventually unveil its dark secrets and face the most dangerous bosses that Wraeclast has ever seen. In the true Path of Exile way, the Atlas of Worlds has its own Passive Skill Tree. Earn skill points for the Tree by completing maps on the Atlas and create your own unique endgame experience. Deadly Missions In your journey through Wraeclast, you will meet fellow Exiles who seek your help. Capture wild beasts for Einhar, delve into the depths of the Azurite Mine with Niko, explore the secrets of the Temple of Atzoatl with Alva or investigate a mysterious Immortal Syndicate with Jun. Once received, these missions can be completed at any time in the endgame. This optional content in Path of Exile will reward you with valuable currency, powerful tradeable items and new ways of crafting. Customise Your Hideout ‚ÄãIn your extensive travels throughout the Acts and the Atlas of Worlds, you will discover secret locations swarmed with dangerous monsters. Defeat them, claim the Hideout for yourself and create your own personalised town. Use your Hideout as a quiet place to trade with other Exiles, craft after battle, or expand it and use it as a personalised Guild Hall with hundreds of decorations. Be Ruthless Ruthless is an optional game mode which offers a more challenging way to play Path of Exile. Ruthless players can expect extreme item scarcity, limited crafting and many other changes such as support gems being drop-only. Ruthless is a mode about friction, tension and anticipation. It's much more difficult, but overcoming that difficulty feels highly rewarding. In a world where your items are far below par, every item drop has the potential to be the breakthrough one you need. Fair-To-Play. Never Pay-To-Win. We're committed to creating a fair playing field for all players.

700330;SCP: Secret Laboratory;29.12.2017;0;0.0;0;Deep within one of the SCP Foundation‚Äôs emergency containment sites, a catastrophic containment breach leads to multiple SCP subjects being released from their cells. With containment compromised, facility personnel rush to evacuate while waiting for Mobile Task Forces to arrive and restore order, but with the Class-D population running amok in a desperate attempt to escape, along with the involvement of the Chaos Insurgency, the fate of Site-02 remains uncertain. SCP: Secret Laboratory (SCP:SL) is a free-to-play multiplayer horror game where you must escape from fearsome entities, or fight to secure a facility under the control of the SCP Foundation, an organisation which seeks to secure and contain anomalous items and creatures in order to protect humanity. These objects, or SCPs, range from mundane-looking items with extraordinary effects, to horrific abominations capable of bypassing the most impenetrable containment methods the Foundation puts in place. Throughout the game, you will witness the perspective of the 5 different human classes, each trying desperately to survive. These include: Scientists: Foundation personnel caught in the midst of the chaos, they must work with Facility Guards and the Mobile Task Force while using their equipment and wits to escape. Class-D Personnel: Prisoners and test subjects using the breach to their advantage, they start with nothing and will do anything it takes to escape from the Foundation. Facility Guards: The woefully unequipped first responders who must help the Scientists escape, prevent the Class-D from escaping, and hold back the SCPs for as long as possible until the Mobile Task Force arrive. Mobile Task Force: Specialised re-containment agents sent into containment breaches to restore order and eliminate threats, they are tasked with assisting in the evacuation of Scientists and taking down anything that poses a threat to the Foundation. Chaos Insurgency: Soldiers of an unknown directive, who are ordered to attack major Foundation sites and terminate all Foundation personnel. They also aim to rescue Class-D Personnel in order to gather useful information from them. Site-02 is a sprawling maze of different zones. Light Containment Zone, where Scientists and Class-D Personnel reside. Heavy Containment Zone, where the SCPs are contained. Entrance Zone, where Facility Guards are stationed, and Surface Zone, where the evacuation point is located, along with the insertion points for Mobile Task Forces and Chaos Insurgents. The site is prepared for these breaches, containing numerous emergency measures ‚Äî from Tesla Gates able to electrocute anything caught in the blast, to emergency bulkheads able to temporarily hold back threats from a fleeing target, or even the on-site nuclear warhead capable of vaporising the entire underground section of the site. Despite all the security precautions and safety measures, Site-02 is not impenetrable . Fight alongside and against other players in order to help the Foundation restore containment and order, sabotage the site as the Insurgency, or kill everyone as a SCP in a murderous rampage. ‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨ SCP:SL was initially inspired by the well-known single-player horror game, SCP ‚Äì Containment Breach (2012) by Undertow Games.

49520;Borderlands 2;17.09.2012;17;19.99;5;Borderlands Collection: Pandora's Box This title is included in Borderlands Collection: Pandora's Box! About the Game A new era of shoot and loot is about to begin. Play as one of four new vault hunters facing off against a massive new world of creatures, psychos and the evil mastermind, Handsome Jack. Make new friends, arm them with a bazillion weapons and fight alongside them in 4 player co-op on a relentless quest for revenge and redemption across the undiscovered and unpredictable living planet. Key Features: All-New Characters and All-New Classes: Four all new playable classes including the Siren, the Commando, the Gunzerker and the Assassin. Step into the role of the Gunzerker, whose highly deadly skills allow him to dual-wield any two weapons found in the game. Not only that, you will build on that skill to do more things with two guns than you ever imagined possible. Dual machine guns? Cool. Dual rocket launchers? Of course! Dual Sniper Rifles? Sure, if that‚Äôs your thing! Want to try other styles? More tactical perhaps? There are multiple classes to choose from! Dynamic Co-op online, and LAN: Share your adventures with friends both online and via LAN. Borderlands 2 features a seamless system enabling you to drop in and drop out of a campaign without ever having to restart the game. On top of that you can even take your new gear from any game to any other! World Connected Story: Find yourself left for dead in the frozen tundra of Pandora as you begin your quest of revenge and redemption. Expose the evil surrounding the Hyperion Corporation and take on the perpetrator of a universe-wide grand deception -- the nefarious Hyperion CEO, Handsome Jack. (Oh, also: he's stolen credit for the opening of the Vault.) 87 Bazillion...Everything: In addition to the new gun system, you will lust after procedurally generated shields, grenades, Relics, class mods and much, much more. And you thought the original Borderlands had a ton of loot! Brand new environments on Pandora: Hunt through entirely brand new areas of Pandora that are more alive than ever! From the arctic tundra, through the dangerous grasslands, past the mysterious corrosive caverns to beyond, you‚Äôll be surprised by the unpredictable world of Pandora at every turn! Brand new enemies: A whole slew of new enemies are out there to kill you in Borderlands 2. Hulking, gorilla-like Bullymongs, vicious predatory Stalkers and the Hyperion mechanical army, run by Handsome Jack, are just some of the new enemies in Borderlands 2.

What school of martial arts will you establish? The choice is yours. There are treasures to be found in every corner of this world. From the Manual Pavilion to the mystic realms and beyond, you never know what you might discover. And with hundreds of rare and exotic monsters, fellow cultivators, ghosts, demons, and immortals to test your strength against, you'll never be bored. If you're up for a challenge, why not try your luck at the Immortal Tournament or the Master Rankings? Can you break through the barriers of the Nether Mountains? Will your school rise to the occasion and prove its worth? As you journey through this perilous world, your school will be put to the test. Sharpen your skills and harness the power of tools! At the start, you get to choose from three formidable weapons, each offering a distinct cultivation system. The Bagua Jade grants you the ability to revive yourself and your chosen ally, the Eye of Providence allows you to steal Beast Skills and gain unparalleled insights into the world, and the Mythical Gourd empowers you to capture a Boss and enlist it as your loyal sidekick: command it to fight by your side or to search for treasure on your behalf.

Los Sue√±os - The LSPD reports a massive upsurge in violent crime across the greater Los Sue√±os area. Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams have been dispatched to respond to various scenes involving high-risk hostage situations, active bomb threats, barricaded suspects, and other criminal activities. Citizens are being advised to practice caution when traveling the city or to stay at home. It has been noted that while Los Sue√±os is still seen as a city where riches can be found, for many more the finer things in life are becoming less and less obtainable. ‚ÄúThe city is sprawling with cramped high-rise apartments and decaying affordable housing, which has been exploited by the criminal underground like a malevolent parasite,‚Äù states Chief Galo √Ålvarez. ‚ÄúIn a city where people are just trying to survive, lawful action from the LSPD and the LSPD SWAT team remains an integral force preventing the stretched thin social fabric in this city from snapping under this chaotic strain.‚Äù In response to the burgeoning violent crime wave inundating Los Sue√±os, Chief √Ålvarez of the LSPD has enlisted the stalwart support of David ‚ÄòJudge‚Äô Beaumont as the Commander of the LSPD SWAT team. Shortly following this announcement, the LSPD has also confirmed active recruitment for additional talent to join this specialized tactical police unit with the mission of bringing peace back to the city. ‚ÄúThis assignment is not for the faint of heart,‚Äù comments Commander Beaumont, ‚ÄúExtremists, crooked politicians, countless weapons, human trafficking, and illicit drugs and pornography‚Ä¶ the world of policing in Los Sue√±os is fraught with real and harsh realities, realities that the everyday person isn‚Äôt necessarily confronted with. These are realities that you will need to navigate with your team within the proper bounds of the law or face the consequences and make matters worse.‚Äù The Los Sue√±os Policed Department has officially posted new details on Commander ‚ÄúJudge‚Äù Beaumont‚Äôs updated assignment with the LSPD SWAT team: New Expectations: Whether this is your first time in Los Sue√±os or not, the city has changed and so too have the tools and methods with which we conduct our work. The haunts you might have seen or heard about are re-imagined, and so have the angles with which we approach each call. Furthermore, we‚Äôve received reports that identify at least 4 new high-risk police districts which we suspect may require future tactical intervention, plus at least 4 existing high-risk districts that underwent massive upheavals. Take Command: The role of the Commander of the LSPD SWAT is to compose their team from a large roster with unique talents, give tactical orders, meticulously plan, and carry out missions. Commanders are obligated to conduct each mission with integrity and look after their team‚Äôs mental and physical health. Officers with unaddressed deteriorating mental status may be unable to properly perform their duties or even feel compelled to quit the force. Incapacitated officers may be temporarily unavailable for missions, with the tragic prospect of death leading to a permanent loss. For SWAT Commanders in unusual circumstances based on individual choices they opt for, deadly mistakes may lead to their own permanent fatality. SWAT Team Quality Enhancement: Much anticipated improved SWAT training procedures, tactics, and experience in the LSPD has led to an overall increase in the quality and quantity of officers in our roster. Expanded tactical versatility allows our officers to take on any challenge with renewed confidence, blending coordination and independence seamlessly. There is also additional basic training now available to SWAT members to keep foundational knowledge and muscle memory in top shape. Equipment and customization: We have access to the best weapons and equipment that the LSPD can offer to fulfill our exceptionally dangerous role, including many new acquisitions. However, customization isn‚Äôt limited to the equipment we use. Through close-knit comradery while performing remarkable actions alongside the team, you‚Äôll earn the clothes you wear, the patches on your sleeves, the artwork that may adorn your skin, and potentially even the timepiece on your wrist. Lastly, we have overhauled our headquarters' training facilities to better test our loadouts before heading out on call. ;Be sure to join the Ready or Not Discord server to keep up with the latest updates, find recruits for your squad, and have a good time!

294100;RimWorld;17.10.2018;0;34.99;8;RimWorld is a sci-fi colony sim driven by an intelligent AI storyteller. Inspired by Dwarf Fortress, Firefly, and Dune. You begin with three survivors of a shipwreck on a distant world. Manage colonists' moods, needs, wounds, illnesses and addictions. Build in the forest, desert, jungle, tundra, and more. Watch colonists develop and break relationships with family members, lovers, and spouses. Replace wounded limbs and organs with prosthetics, bionics, or biological parts harvested from others. Fight pirates, tribes, mad animals, giant insects and ancient killing machines. Craft structures, weapons, and apparel from metal, wood, stone, cloth, and futuristic materials. Tame and train cute pets, productive farm animals, and deadly attack beasts. Trade with passing ships and caravans. Form caravans to complete quests, trade, attack other factions, or migrate your whole colony. Dig through snow, weather storms, and fight fires. Capture refugees or prisoners and turn them to your side or sell them into slavery. Discover a new generated world each time you play. Explore hundreds of wild and interesting mods on the Steam Workshop. Learn to play easily with the help of an intelligent and unobtrusive AI tutor. RimWorld is a story generator. It‚Äôs designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the ‚Äúrandom‚Äù events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the AI Storyteller . There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax. Your colonists are not professional settlers ‚Äì they‚Äôre crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You‚Äôll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew. Each person‚Äôs background is tracked and affects how they play. A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill ‚Äì but he does that very well. Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships. Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound. The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator. You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season. Travel across the planet. You're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster. You can tame and train animals. Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms. People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment. They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations.

Inspired by Dwarf Fortress, Firefly, and Dune. You begin with three survivors of a shipwreck on a distant world. Manage colonists' moods, needs, wounds, illnesses and addictions. Build in the forest, desert, jungle, tundra, and more. Watch colonists develop and break relationships with family members, lovers, and spouses. Replace wounded limbs and organs with prosthetics, bionics, or biological parts harvested from others. Fight pirates, tribes, mad animals, giant insects and ancient killing machines. Craft structures, weapons, and apparel from metal, wood, stone, cloth, and futuristic materials. Tame and train cute pets, productive farm animals, and deadly attack beasts. Trade with passing ships and caravans. Form caravans to complete quests, trade, attack other factions, or migrate your whole colony. Dig through snow, weather storms, and fight fires. Capture refugees or prisoners and turn them to your side or sell them into slavery. Discover a new generated world each time you play. Explore hundreds of wild and interesting mods on the Steam Workshop. Learn to play easily with the help of an intelligent and unobtrusive AI tutor. RimWorld is a story generator. It‚Äôs designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the ‚Äúrandom‚Äù events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the AI Storyteller . There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax. Your colonists are not professional settlers ‚Äì they‚Äôre crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You‚Äôll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew. Each person‚Äôs background is tracked and affects how they play. A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill ‚Äì but he does that very well. Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships. Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound. The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator. You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season. Travel across the planet. You're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster. You can tame and train animals. Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms. People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment. They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations.

From a 3/4 overhead perspective, players explore the fantasy world of Rivellon, interact with various characters, and engage in turn-based combat against human enemies and fantastical creatures (e.g., demons, skeletons, giant insects). Characters use weapon strikes and magic attacks to defeat enemies in combat; battles are accompanied by blood-splatter effects that stain the surrounding environment. Some areas depict large pools of blood amid human corpses and dismembered limbs.

As players explore an open-world environment in Ancient Greece, they interact with characters, infiltrate enemy bases and strongholds, and kill human enemies. Players use swords, spears, and bows to kill enemy soldiers and bandits in melee-style combat. Players also use stealth attacks (e.g., knife stabbing) to dispatch enemies discreetly. Large blood-splatter effects occur as enemies are killed. A handful of cutscenes depict more intense acts of violence and/or gore: characters stabbed through the head/neck with bladed weapons; young characters thrown off a cliff; a man mauled by a mob as his arm gets thrown into the air. Some environments depict severed limbs and dismembered corpses on the ground. The game contains instances of sexual material: characters kissing and caressing before the screen fades to black (sex is implied though never shown); dialogue referencing sex and prostitution (e.g., ‚ÄúAnything goes in this sex andron‚Äù; ‚ÄúThat is love, this is commerce. What are you into?‚Äù); a character hearing sexual moaning sounds behind a door. The words ‚Äúf**k‚Äù and ‚Äúsh*t‚Äù are heard in the game.

About the Game It‚Äôs been 20 years since the events of the original game. The virus won, and humanity is slowly dying. You play as Aiden Caldwell, a wandering Pilgrim who delivers goods, brings news, and connects the few remaining survivor settlements in barren lands devastated by the zombie virus. However, your true goal is to find your little sister Mia, who you left behind as a kid to escape Dr. Waltz's torturous experiments. Haunted by the past, you eventually make the decision to confront it when you learn that Mia may still be alive in Villedor ‚Äî the last city standing on Earth. You quickly find yourself in a settlement torn by conflict. You‚Äôll need to engage in creative and gory combat, so hone your skills to defeat hordes of zombies and make allies. Roam the city, free run across Villedor‚Äôs buildings and rooftops in search of loot in remote areas, and be wary of the night. With every sunset, monsters take control of the streets. Fifteen years ago, humanity was devastated by the Fall ‚Äî a catastrophic event that would change the world forever. With the Harran virus spreading around the globe, people quickly found out that all hope for tomorrow is lost. By 2036, only a few settlements remain, and humanity is slowly dying, making way for the new species out there ‚Äî a horde of relentless zombies. Welcome to Villedor, one of the last bastions of humanity. During the day, survivors still try to have a life here and find a false sense of normalcy. Relationships are formed, dreams are dreamed, and life carries on. On the surface, everything seems‚Ä¶ fine. Until sunset, that is. With the last ray of light dying out, other, more dreadful, dwellers of The City crawl out of their gloomy interiors, taking over the streets. If you are not vigilant and stay out too long in the dark, you may never return. Not all fights can be won. Sometimes it‚Äôs best to run and, thankfully, you have the skills for it. Parkour lets you escape when odds are not in your favor. Jump from rooftop to rooftop, swing across the cityscape, ride ziplines, and much more. Whatever you do, experience a unique sense of freedom as you freerun across Villedor‚Äôs buildings and rooftops in search of loot or while running away from the dangers of the night. In a world as dangerous as this one, only the strongest survive. Whether you prefer to smash, slice or dismember those who stand in your way, you have to be creative about it to make it through. And who says you need weapons? Utilize the entirety of your parkour moveset to get the jump on your enemies. Learn the ways of combat and parkour to feel the crunch of skulls and slices of flesh as you swing weapons or use your moves to fend off any forms of danger. And let‚Äôs not forget that Villedor has weapons that put the most advanced post-apocalyptic armories to shame. Surviving in Villedor is easier with friends. Team up with up to 3 other players and increase your chances out there. Unravel the story together, take on Pilgrim Outpost challenges, or simply wreak havoc on the city streets. ;It‚Äôs been 20 years since the events of the original game.

Dead Cells puts you in control of a failed alchemic experiment trying to figure out what's happening on a sprawling, ever-changing and seemingly cursed Island. Immortal but crippled, your last resort is to take over bodies in order to move, explore‚Ä¶ and fight. While you may well be immortal, the corpses you possess are not.

Each new adventure holds almost limitless possibilities.;‚ÄúCalling Stellaris Europa Universalis in space is probably reductive, but it was the first thing I did in this review not because they are almost exactly alike, but because, when I put away my empires and get on with my day, the stories that have played out in these digital worlds embed themselves in my brain, and I so desperately want to tell people about them. Both games tickle the part of my brain that wants every battle to have some greater context, every move I make to be part of a larger narrative.

Avenge the death of your parents and help repel the invading forces! Story: Bohemia ‚Äì located in the heart of Europe, the region is rich in culture, silver, and sprawling castles. The death of its beloved ruler, Emperor Charles IV, has plunged the kingdom into dark times: war, corruption, and discord are tearing this jewel of the Holy Roman Empire apart. One of Charles' sons, Wenceslas, has inherited the crown. Unlike his father, Wenceslas is a naive, self-indulgent, unambitious monarch. His half-brother and King of Hungary, Sigismund the Red Fox, senses weakness in Wenceslas. Feigning good will, Sigismund travels to Bohemia and kidnaps his half-brother. With no king on the throne, Sigismund is now free to plunder Bohemia and seize its riches. In the midst of this chaos, you're Henry, the son of a blacksmith. Your peaceful life is shattered when a mercenary raid, ordered by King Sigismund himself, burns your village to the ground. By bittersweet fortune, you are one of the few survivors of this massacre. Without a home, family, or future you end up in the service of Lord Radzig Kobyla, who is forming a resistance against the invasion. Fate drags you into this bloody conflict and shoves you into a raging civil war, where you help fight for the future of Bohemia.

Guide colonists through the perils of subterranean asteroid living and watch as their population grows until they're not simply surviving, but thriving... Just make sure you don't forget to breathe. Build Extensive Bases and Discover What it Takes to Survive: Everything in your space colony is under your control, from excavation and resource allocation right down to plumbing and power systems. Resources will begin depleting with your first breath, however, so be sure to dig fast if you want to live. It‚Äôs Mind Over Matter with Stress Simulations: Keep the psychological impact of survival at bay with fun leisure activities, great accommodations and even better food for your colony. Duplicants each have different and potentially destructive ways of reacting to stress, so be sure to always keep them happy. Whatever the cost. Avoid Boiling with Thermodynamics: Temperature control is a constant concern in space; too cold and you'll freeze, too hot and you'll fry. Keep tabs on ambient environmental temperatures and your colony's heat production to maintain a nice, cozy atmosphere for your colonists. Enhance Efficiency through Complex Gas and Liquid Simulations: Create interlocking pipe systems to swiftly deliver fuel and liquid to critical areas of your base. Plan well and be rewarded as your colony transforms into an imperishable, well-oiled machine. Take Charge with Power Grid Simulations: Choose from a multitude of power sources including coal, hydrogen, natural gas or just plain old elbow grease. Manage power runoff, circuit overloads and meltdowns to keep your colony running smoothly. Always Keep Yourself Breathing: Enter the Oxygen Overlay and watch air moving through your base in real time. Monitor carbon dioxide accumulation and oversee oxygen generation processes to mold your colony into a veritable deep-space oasis. Waste Nothing through Extreme Recycling: Make use of every last resource for a base that truly exemplifies efficiency. Recycle waste into precious fuel, process unbreathable gas into air or harness the natural bodily processes of wild creatures for food. If you‚Äôre clever, you might even be able to run a base off colonist farts. Explore Diverse, Procedurally Generated New Worlds: Summon new worlds with a push of a button.

Extremely detailed with single player and multiplayer options, exclusive licensed cars reproduced with the best accuracy possible, thanks to the official cooperation of Car Manufacturers. ASSETTO CORSA has been developed at the KUNOS Simulazioni R&amp;D office, located just inside the international racing circuit of Vallelunga, allowing the team to develop the game with the cooperation of real world racing drivers and racing teams. LEGENDARY TRACKS The circuits have been developed using Laser scan technology, in order to guarantee the highest level of accuracy possible in reproducing real world motor racing environments. Monza, Silverstone, Imola, Mugello, Spa, Brands Hatch and many more tracks, including the historical reproduction of Monza, that brings again to life the legendary Sopraelevata, the high-speed oval where races were staged until 1961. EXCLUSIVE CARS The Assetto Corsa physics engine is all new, using practical knowledge acquired from working closely with the elite of motorsport in order to engineer the best possible accuracy of physics and tactility of feeling. A physics engine like this begs to be used with officially licensed contents: Abarth, Audi, BMW, Classic Team Lotus, Ferrari, KTM, Lamborghini, Lotus cars, McLaren, Mercedes, Scuderia Glickenhaus, Pagani, Porsche, Tatuus and many more! HARDWARE COMPATIBILITY Enjoy ASSETTO CORSA using any kind of game device: keyboard, joypad, joystick, steering wheels including any kind of professional device and the most common motion systems. ASSETTO CORSA is also compatible and ready for Oculus and OpenVR/VIVE, triple monitor view, Track IR and 3D VISION. GAMEPLAY &amp; FEATURES Assetto Corsa includes a career mode, a list of special and unique events and challenges, as well as a fully customizable, single player and multiplayer modes featuring quick races, custom championships, race weekends including free practice session, qualifying session and race. Drag races, drift challenges and much more! Four driving assist profiles (gamer, racer, pro, plus a fully-customizable profile) allow any kind of player to enjoy the simulation at their desired level. Advanced setup options and telemetry for data analysis; dynamic simulation of the tyre rubber deposited on track, depending on the car laps; an adjustable time of the day mode, featuring sun position calculated in realtime, depending by geographical coordinates of the track and by the sun curve according to time and date, in order to get the same light conditions of the real tracks! MODDING &amp; CUSTOMIZATION Assetto Corsa will allow for considerable customisation and modification, in order to satisfy the expectations of professional simracers, gamers who prefer to approach the driving experience more progressively, and hobbyists who just like to reproduce and share their cars and tracks, taking advantage of the same editing tools developed and used by the developers of the game.

RESHAPE THE ENVIRONMENT Astroneers are trained to use the Terrain Tool, a powerful instrument which can dig, collect, shape, build, and color terrain in any way they wish. GO HANDS-ON WITH BASEBUILDING Build custom bases throughout the solar system to survive and thrive anywhere! Objects are snapped into place in a modular system that allows Astroneers to create unique builds. Automation systems, crafting stations, power plants, resource harvesters, and railway facilities are built from the ground up and can be customized to suit any situation. LEARN TO SURVIVE A STRANGE SOLAR SYSTEM This unrecognized system consists of seven celestial bodies. Each of them can be explored entirely, from the rounded surface all the way down into the core. Astroneers will have to grapple with their unique geography and challenging biomes if they seek to understand them. UNCOVER THE MYSTERIES OF THE UNIVERSE These strange worlds are dotted with mysterious structures and artifacts, while Astroneers themselves receive confusing comms from unknown sources.

2694490;Path of Exile 2;06.12.2024;0;29.99;3;Path of Exile 2 is a next generation Action RPG from Grinding Gear Games, featuring co-op for up to six players. Path of Exile 2 takes place in the land of Wraeclast, a dark continent populated by unique cultures, ancient secrets, and monstrous dangers. A sinister threat, long thought destroyed, has begun creeping back on the edge of civilisation, driving people mad and sickening the land with Corruption. Path of Exile 2 features a brand new campaign with six acts, 100 distinct environments, 600 monsters and 100 bosses. Key Features Twelve Character Classes Path of Exile 2 features twelve character classes, two for every combination of Strength, Dexterity and Intelligence. While each of the class variants focuses on a different playstyle, they're just a starting point. You can combine skills from many classes together to create your ideal character build. Each of the twelve character classes has its own three Ascendancy specialisations, resulting in a total of 36 Ascendancy Classes to pick between. New Skill Gem System Path of Exile 2 features 240 Skill Gems that grant devastating active skills and 200 Support Gems that modify their behaviour. Combine these together to create your perfect build. This is the next generation of Path of Exile's famous skill system. Support Gems are now socketed directly into Skill Gems, removing many of the frustrations present in the old system while maintaining all the previous depth. It's now possible to six-link every skill your character uses. Dual-specialise your Passive Skill Tree Path of Exile's iconic Passive Skill Tree has made a return, with 1,500 skills that allow you to completely customise your gameplay experience. It now features Dual Specialisation, the ability to allocate some passive skill points to two different sets of skills. They engage whenever the appropriate weapon or skill type is used. For example, you can have some points allocated to both daggers and traps, or ice and lightning, and as you swap between attacks, the appropriate skill points will apply. This lets you specialise in multiple areas without opportunity cost. Uncover All-new Items Path of Exile 2 features 700 equipment base types and every single one has its own unique item you can find. You can augment your arsenal with new weapons such as Spears, Crossbows and Flails, as well as supplementary items like Focuses, Traps and redesigned Sceptres. Encounter Unique Bosses In Path of Exile 2, every area of the Campaign contains a boss encounter. There's over a hundred bosses to fight as you make your way through the Acts and they all have unique mechanics to learn. Explore a New Endgame Completing the campaign is just the beginning. The endgame in Path of Exile 2 includes countless areas in different biomes, powerful crafting, challenging bosses, unique encounters and much more. Unlock new paths and explore further into the world.¬† As you progress through the endgame, you will gain access to special passive trees that can boost the rewards of your maps and change the way the various endgame mechanics work. These trees will make your maps more rewarding but also more difficult. Path of Exile 2 introduces sequels to several leagues from Path of Exile. While their mechanics are familiar, the monsters, bosses, rewards and progression are all new. Fair-To-Play. Never Pay-To-Win. Path of Exile 2 is a separate game to the original Path of Exile. We will continue to offer expansions for both games going forward. They will never be 'pay to win'. Purchases are shared between the two games. ;Path of Exile 2 is a next generation Action RPG from Grinding Gear Games, featuring co-op for up to six players.

There is also a new scenario - The Fall of Winterhome , that further expands the game‚Äôs universe and lore. And for the dessert, we‚Äôve added things like naming characters and automatons and finally a photo mode . All of this is available for free for all the owners of the game. There are also three expansions, available with the paid Season Pass .

Of course the game will still receive patches and fixes and we‚Äôll provide the technical support. SEASON PASS The Official Season Pass for Frostpunk is out and complete! It grants you access to all additional content released for the game since the premiere, including three expansions ( The Last Autumn , On The Edge and The Rifts ), that widely broaden the main story and fill a lot of gaps in the game‚Äôs universe. What‚Äôs more, when you‚Äôre done with the game itself, you‚Äôll be able to unwind while listening to the Digital Soundtrack featuring orchestrated music or learn more about the world with the exclusive Digital Artbook . Not having the game at all? Worry no more, as the Frostpunk: Game of the Year Edition is what you are looking for. It includes the main game, season pass and all exclusive content at a discounted price. ABOUT THE GAME THE CITY MUST SURVIVE Frostpunk, the newest title from the creators of This War of Mine, is a society survival game where heat means life and every decision comes at a price. In an entirely frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. You face the task of building the last city on Earth and securing the means necessary for your community to survive. Optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management will consume most of the ruler‚Äôs time, at some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its history and present state. What decisions will you make to ensure the survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And who will you become in the process? MAKE THE LAW Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment ‚Äì the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe. SHAPE YOUR SOCIETY If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Whichever you choose, remember: there‚Äôs no turning back. WEIGH UP YOUR CHOICES Some of your decisions will seem small ‚Äì like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction ‚Äì but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. Leadership can be a burden. DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES Survival demands progress. React to current events, but don‚Äôt forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills. EXPLORE THE FROSTLAND While New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society‚Äôs population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands. PLAY ENDLESSLY Frostpunk Endless Mode grants you unlimited replayability for the game. Play on 8 various maps, with different terrain, weather conditions and challenges to face. We know that different people look for different experiences and that‚Äôs why there are 3 modes to play in Endless Mode. Endurance will be an ultimate test to your building, managing and survival skills in the harshest conditions. Builders, where there is no generator available from the start, which creates a different type of challenge. And last but not least, Serenity which is focused on enjoying the art of building the city itself, without unnecessary pressure. ;END OF THE ROAD Since the premiere, Frostpunk has been enriched with a number of updates.

SHAPE YOUR SOCIETY If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Whichever you choose, remember: there‚Äôs no turning back. WEIGH UP YOUR CHOICES Some of your decisions will seem small ‚Äì like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction ‚Äì but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. Leadership can be a burden. DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES Survival demands progress. React to current events, but don‚Äôt forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills. EXPLORE THE FROSTLAND While New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society‚Äôs population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands. PLAY ENDLESSLY Frostpunk Endless Mode grants you unlimited replayability for the game. Play on 8 various maps, with different terrain, weather conditions and challenges to face.

About the Game Space Engineers is an open world sandbox game defined by creativity and exploration. It is a sandbox game about engineering, construction, exploration and survival in space and on planets. Players build space ships, wheeled vehicles, space stations, planetary outposts of various sizes and uses (civil and military), pilot ships and travel through space to explore planets and gather resources to survive. Featuring both creative and survival modes, there is no limit to what can be built, utilized and explored. Space Engineers features a realistic, volumetric-based physics engine: everything in the game can be assembled, disassembled, damaged and destroyed. The game can be played either in single or multiplayer modes. Volumetric objects are structures composed from block-like modules interlocked in a grid. Volumetric objects behave like real physical objects with mass, inertia and velocity. Individual modules have real volume and storage capacity. Space Engineers is inspired by reality and by how things work. Think about modern-day NASA technology extrapolated 60 years into the future. Space Engineers strives to follow the laws of physics and doesn't use technologies that wouldn't be feasible in the near future. Space Engineers concentrates on construction and exploration aspects, but can be played as a survival shooter as well. We expect players will avoid engaging in direct man-to-man combat and instead use their creativity and engineering skills to build war machines and fortifications to survive in space and on planets.

Simple worlds run smoothly even on low-end computers, but a more complex world with rich object interactions could overload even high-end computers. Minimum requirements represent the bare minimum to run simple scenes and don‚Äôt guarantee a perfect experience.";Space Engineers is a sandbox game about engineering, construction, exploration and survival in space and on planets. Players build space ships, space stations, planetary outposts of various sizes and uses, pilot ships and travel through space to explore planets and gather resources to survive.;‚ÄúSpace Engineers bring you back to your childhood when you were fighting with your LEGO ships.‚Äù 9/10 ‚Äì SCORE ‚ÄúSpace Engineers makes welding, joining and glazing seem like the best jobs in the world.

305620;The Long Dark;01.08.2017;0;9.99;4;"Bright lights flare across the night sky. The wind rages outside the thin walls of your wooden cabin. A wolf howls in the distance. You look at the meager supplies in your pack, and wish for the days before the power mysteriously went out. How much longer will you survive? Welcome to THE LONG DARK , the innovative exploration-survival experience Wired magazine calls 'the pinnacle of an entire genre'. THE LONG DARK is a thoughtful, exploration-survival experience that challenges solo players to think for themselves as they explore an expansive frozen wilderness in the aftermath of a geomagnetic disaster. There are no zombies -- only you, the cold, and all the threats Mother Nature can muster. THE LONG DARK: SURVIVAL EDITION brings you the genre-defining Survival Mode, honed after years of open development and frequent updates. Widely considered the paramount Survival game of all time, SURVIVAL EDITION gives you pure focus on THE LONG DARK‚Äôs Survival Sandbox -- the experience that started it all! In THE LONG DARK , you are getting both the genre-defining Survival Mode, honed after years of open development and frequent updates, and the award-winning episodic narrative mode, WINTERMUTE. Included with both THE LONG DARK: SURVIVAL EDITION and THE LONG DARK , Survival Mode is the free-form, non-narrative Survival Sandbox that has defined the genre since launching on Steam in 2014. After years of open development and dozens of major updates, THE LONG DARK now stands at the pinnacle of the entire genre. Survival is your only goal, and death your only end. Make your own survival story with every game. The game that defined death for the survival genre. When you die in Survival, your save is deleted. Every decision matters. The game challenges players to think for themselves by providing the information but never the answers. You have to earn the right to survive. Monitor your Hunger, Thirst, Fatigue, and Cold as you struggle to balance resources with the energy needed to obtain them. Every action costs Calories, and time is your most precious resource. Choose your path carefully. Over 100 gear items including Tools, Light Sources, Weapons, First Aid supplies, Clothing, and more. Explore a 50+ square kilometer Northern Canadian wilderness spanning 12 major regions and all the zones that connect them in search of life-saving supplies. Distant mountains, coastal towns, mines, farmlands, and a huge expanse of brutal winter wilderness to test your survival mettle. Hunt, fish, trap, climb, map, search for life-saving food and gear items, and try to avoid dying from the hostile wildlife, succumbing to hypothermia, frostbite, or dysentery (amongst other uncomfortable afflictions), find and maintain your life-saving gear. Hunt and be hunted by: Wolves, Bears, Moose, Rabbits, Deers, Crows, and more to come in future updates. Four distinct Experience Modes let you find a challenge level you are comfortable with, such as Pilgrim Mode, which is meant to be quiet and pensive, all the way to Interloper Mode, where only the most experienced survivors have a chance to last a week. If none of the four Experiences suits you, use Custom Mode settings to tailor your Survival Mode game to your specific tastes. Features the music of Sascha Dikiciyan. Several standalone Challenge Modes offer objective-based experiences designed to last 1-3 hours each, such as Whiteout -- the race to gather enough supplies to prepare for a monster blizzard. Or Hunted, where you need to escape a murderous Bear. Complete them to unlock Feats that provide long-term gameplay benefits in Survival Mode. Additional Challenges include: Hopeless Rescue, Nomad, Archivist, As the Dead Sleep, and Escape the Darkwalker. Included in THE LONG DARK The episodic story-mode for THE LONG DARK, WINTERMUTE, includes four of the five episodes that form WINTERMUTE. Episode Five is in development, and is slated for release at a later date. This will bring the WINTERMUTE storyline to its conclusion. The first four episodes of WINTERMUTE represent approximately 30 hours of gameplay. Episode Five is included in the price of the game, and will be unlocked for free when it is released. Bush pilot Will Mackenzie (player character) and Dr. Astrid Greenwood are separated after their plane crashes deep in the Northern Canadian wilderness in the aftermath of a mysterious flash of light in the sky. Struggling to survive as he desperately searches for Astrid, Mackenzie comes across the small town of Milton, where he begins to understand the scope of this quiet apocalypse. Mackenzie‚Äôs search for Astrid takes him deeper into the savage Winter wilderness. A mysterious trapper may be the key to finding Astrid, but can he be trusted? In the aftermath of events in Milton, an enigmatic stranger rescues Dr. Astrid Greenwood (player character) from near death. Facing the blizzards of Pleasant Valley, Astrid must bring all her skills as a doctor to bear on the survivors she encounters. But will she find Mackenzie, and get closer to the mystery that's taking them to Perseverance Mills? A murderous gang of convicts has captured Mackenzie. Desperate to escape one of the darkest corners of Great Bear Island, he must somehow survive his fiercest enemy yet. Can Mackenzie recover the Hardcase, continue his search for Astrid, and also save the innocents caught up in this deadly confrontation? NOTE: Unlike Survival Mode, WINTERMUTE does not feature permadeath. You can save your progress as you play. Features performances by Jennifer Hale, Mark Meer, David Hayter, and Elias Toufexis (Episode Three), and the music of Cris Velasco. In addition to releasing the remaining episode of WINTERMUTE, we intend to continue updating Survival Mode with limited free updates alongside our paid DLC Expansion Pass, TALES FROM THE FAR TERRITORY. This is on top of the over 100 updates we have made to the game over the past 8 years of open development. Keep in mind that your purchase of THE LONG DARK entitles you to all five episodes of WINTERMUTE without extra charge. For more information about the free updates coming to Survival Mode, please visit the Expansion Pass roadmap via our 'Visit the website' link on the right of the page.

Surrounded by five others, a third of your group have been infected with the Game Master‚Äôs deadly virus and tasked with taking down the other innocent players. Innocents must stay alert, traverse the three zones and escape through the safety hatch as the infected try to pick you off one by one. When playing as an innocent, you‚Äôll progress through the map and come across items to help you survive as you advance towards the exit. However, you will need to decide which of these are most valuable to you, and whether to collaborate or fight with other players to get your hands on them. Every decision gives you more information on your teammates and what side they‚Äôre likely to be on. A test of strategy and skill, innocents must work together to gather weapons, secure objectives and vote out those suspected of infection to strengthen their chances of survival. But the environment has been setup to cause conflict amongst the group, creating doubt about the true intentions of players. The infected will be busy collecting blood and trying to cover up their sabotage attempts, whilst the innocents will be keeping an eye out for suspicious behaviour and attempting to make alliances with those they think they can trust. At the end of each zone, a blackout period occurs, allowing the infected players to transform into their terror form and attack. You‚Äôll need this form to kill innocent players. In terror form you‚Äôre faster, stronger, and have better vision than your innocent victims and with an array of intense killing animations you‚Äôll be able to create some frightening but also amusing gameplay!

A vertical metropolis of gambling and grit, just beyond the reach of Stonehall and Revtel; White Spire is known as a smugglers' paradise with loose morals and colorful residents to spare. Despite being overrun with syndicates, gangs, and secret societies, White Spire has never descended into chaos for one reason: Momma Eeb.

A vertical metropolis of gambling and grit, just beyond the reach of Stonehall and Revtel; White Spire is known as a smugglers' paradise with loose morals and colorful residents to spare. Despite being overrun with syndicates, gangs, and secret societies, White Spire has never descended into chaos for one reason: Momma Eeb. She was respected... she was loved... and unfortunately, she was murdered last week. Eeb‚Äôs death has sent one question rippling through White Spire‚Äôs underworld: who is going to run the city? STRATEGIZE TO WIN: Recruit heroes and upgrade them into more powerful versions of themselves. MIX AND MATCH: Each hero you recruit can form unique alliances. Stacking your team with allied heroes will unlock powerful bonuses that can crush your rivals. UNDERLORDS: Choose from four Underlords to lead your crew to victory. Underlords are powerful units who fight on the field alongside your crew, and they each bring their own playstyle, perks, and abilities to the table. CROSSPLAY: Play on your platform of choice and battle players across the globe in a hassle-free crossplay experience. Running late? Start a match on your PC and finish it on your mobile device (and vice versa). Your profile in Dota Underlords is shared across all devices, so no matter what you play on, you're always making progress. RANKED MATCHMAKING: Everyone starts at the bottom, but by playing against other Underlords you'll climb through the ranks and prove you're worthy to rule White Spire. TOURNAMENT-READY: Create your own private lobbies and matches, then invite spectators to watch 8 Underlords duke it out. OFFLINE PLAY: Offering a sophisticated AI with 4 levels of difficulty, offline play is a great place to hone your skills. Pause and resume games at your leisure. SEASONAL ROTATION: Every season we'll say goodbye to certain Heroes, Items, and Alliances to make room for new additions that will shape the ever-evolving world of Underlords.";Hire a crew and destroy your rivals in this new strategy battler set in the world of Dota. Introducing Season One: Explore White Spire and earn rewards on the Battle Pass. Pick from several different game modes, play on your own or with friends, and take advantage of crossplay on PC and mobile.;;https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1046930/header.jpg?t=1649700104;http://underlords.com/;https://help.steampowered.com;;PRAWDA;PRAWDA;PRAWDA;0;;0;0;;['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Bulgarian', 'Czech', 'Danish', 'Dutch', 'Finnish', 'Greek', 'Hungarian', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'Norwegian', 'Polish', 'Portuguese - Portugal', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Romanian', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Spanish - Latin America', 'Swedish', 'Thai', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Turkish', 'Ukrainian', 'Vietnamese'];[];[{'title': 'Buy Dota Underlords', 'description': '', 'subs': [{'text': 'Dota Underlords - Commercial License (Free) - Free', 'description': '', 'price': 0.0}]}];['Valve'];['Valve'];['Single-player', 'Multi-player', 'PvP', 'Online PvP', 'Cross-Platform Multiplayer', 'Partial Controller Support', 'Steam Cloud', 'Remote Play on Phone', 'Remote Play on Tablet'];['Casual', 'Free To Play', 'Strategy'];['https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1046930/ss_25ad872bc9a8ecf634a76ce1d4bb22aea9b728c9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649700104', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1046930/ss_1bc613845672667a6e1f957e269543de629ace39.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649700104', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1046930/ss_3eb9d9284194794e69d31b4d764b902d424f1af2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649700104', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1046930/ss_cda4d2ee1a88f6640a8b1cac5c27647ad28a816f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649700104', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1046930/ss_4c73e18e4b0242a25b8bd73576560deb7ff8124d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649700104'];['http://video.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_trailers/256881738/movie_max.mp4?t=1649700096'];0;;74736;16119;5000000 - 10000000;0;0;0;0;0;1323;{'Free to Play': 735, 'Strategy': 600, 'Auto Battler': 506, 'Casual': 485, 'Multiplayer': 266, 'Tactical': 197, 'Chess': 195, 'Turn-Based Tactics': 186, 'Turn-Based': 152, 'Mature': 102, 'Competitive': 91, 'Fantasy': 74, 'Board Game': 71, 'Card Game': 66, 'Deckbuilding': 61, 'Singleplayer': 57, 'PvP': 51, 'Co-op': 44, 'Automation': 42, 'MOBA': 33};82;90859;78;93

1361210;Warhammer 40,000: Darktide;30.11.2022;0;39.99;1;Take back the city of Tertium from hordes of bloodthirsty foes in this intense and brutal action shooter. Warhammer 40,000: Darktide is the new co-op focused experience from the award-winning team behind the Vermintide series. In the depths of the hive, the seeds of corruption threaten to turn into an overwhelming tide of darkness. A mysterious and sinister new force is seeking to take control of the entire city. It is up to you and your allies in the Inquisition to root out the enemy before the city succumbs to Chaos. As Tertium falls, Rejects Will Rise. Built on the legacy of Vermintide 2‚Äôs best-in-class melee combat, Warhammer 40,000: Darktide introduces intense WH40K gunplay to the mix. Master the balance between ranged and melee combat as you fight through a slew of enemies. Feel the impact of each swipe, swing, and slice of a chainsword, or fry some flesh with a lasgun. Darktide is a co-op game. Wandering too far, risks punishment by foes looking to immobilize or capture stray Rejects, such as the slavering Chaos Hound or the Moebian Trapper. Once you fall prey to such foes, only your teammates can save you! More than that, your innate toughness ‚Äì your determination to press on through the pain ‚Äì only recharges when you are in the proximity of your strike team. Create your own, unique character and customize their physical appearance, voice, and origin. Choose your class to determine which unique traits and skill sets they will make use of in battle. Will you be a seasoned veteran of the Imperial army, a snarky outsider, or a fiery zealot? The choice is yours. Step into the violent, dystopian world of Warhammer 40,000. From boiling hot industrial factories to the decaying water maintenance zone afflicted by constant acid rainfall - Tertium Hive is a hard and unforgiving place even at the best of times. Your role is to serve the zealous Inquisition by embarking on missions to exterminate the threats lurking in the depths of the hive city, or die trying. Adapt to the erratic whims of Chaos with conditions- mutators that add a spontaneous challenge to your mission. Your team must learn to adjust, adopt new tactics and change up their loadouts to face these ruthless challenges. ;Take back the city of Tertium from hordes of bloodthirsty foes in this intense and brutal action shooter.

SCUM is a truly immersive and hyper realistic survival experience where you have total control of your progression. You start as a prisoner on the super-max SCUM island under the watchful eye of the sinister TEC1 corporation. Roam the rolling fields, lush forests and other rugged terrains of the island, using skills, guts and cunning to survive. Incredibly complex simulation makes every detail matter. Eat the right diet, keep your wounds free of infection or it won‚Äôt just be the physical threats that take your life. Seek to take out other players or join forces while you loot and craft your way to better gear and weaponry. Flex your creative muscles with extensive base building options and reinforcements that will make your fortress impenetrable. The island is vast and full of ways to die, from fellow prisoners to killer mechs and sinister ‚Äòpuppets‚Äô suspended between life and death. All you have is what you‚Äôre carrying ‚Äì everything else is up to you. Inventory space is minimal. Progression will be tough. Noobs will die. Oh, and one more thing‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre not just a prisoner. TEC1 is also an entertainment company, and they‚Äôre broadcasting every triumph and failure on SCUM island to a bloodthirsty audience of millions. So smile...you‚Äôre on TV. SCUM is built with Unreal Engine 4 and will expand throughout the Early Access period. Fans can follow details on development with weekly dev updates on the SCUM website and on Twitter @SCUMgame. FEATURES Complex Simulation: SCUM utilizes dozens of complex systems, allowing you to go as deep as you choose into character creation and management. Immerse yourself in the survival experience through systems that control your character‚Äôs metabolism, inertia during movement, and even how fast layers of clothing dry on and off the body. The devil is in the details... Massive Landscape: Explore 225 square kilometres of terrain that includes dense forests, picturesque beaches, serene fields, abandoned towns and rundown airfields. This enormous terrain can be traversed by foot, land vehicles, boats or aircraft. Each location tells its own story, presenting new dangers‚Ä¶and opportunities, too. Tough progression: loot what you can and craft with raw materials. Improvise, adapt and upgrade. Think smart, take risks and carry what you need. Build and protect your base with a wide range of customization options. Grow your character and become the terror of the whole island. Omnipresent threat: Discover new ways to die in a punishing world without a moral code. Face your fellow prisoners, armed mechs, undead puppets and your own metabolic system ‚Äì if your rivals don‚Äôt get you, maybe dehydration will. Online Multiplayer: You can go solo or squad up.

222880;Insurgency;22.01.2014;0;14.99;0;Take to the streets for intense close quarters combat, where a team's survival depends upon securing crucial strongholds and destroying enemy supply in this multiplayer and cooperative Source Engine based experience. The follow-up game to the award-winning Source mod, Insurgency is highly competitive and unforgivingly lethal, striking a balance between one-life gameplay and prolonged action. Features Over 40 weapons with numerous attachments, no crosshair, and a focus on realistic weapon behavior including a free-aim system and intense suppression effects. 16 maps playable in day and night versions on various multiplayer and cooperative modes, ranging from environments in the Middle East, Africa, and Central Asia. 7 multiplayer game modes supporting up to 32 players, with a focus on territorial control, destroying weapon caches and escorting high value targets. 5 cooperative game modes where you and your friends team up to complete mission-based objectives. Free content updates that include weapons, game modes, maps, and new features. Offline practice mode, playing with bots on all game modes. Squad system built upon role-based player classes, which are customizable and asymmetrical based on what team you are on. Squad-based communication system which includes 3D VOIP, allowing friendly and enemy players within proximity to hear you. Overhead map detailing objective and teammate locations. Accumulate supply to customize and upgrade your gear, affecting your weight, stamina, and movement speed.

Create custom maps and content using the Insurgency SDK and scripting system, and share them on the Steam Workshop. Playable on PC, Mac OSX, and Linux with multiplayer cross-compatibility. Dedicated Server Support for PC and Linux. Multiplayer Game Modes: Push --- Three territorial objectives must be captured by the attacking team in sequential order. For each objective captured, they gain more reinforcement and time to attack the next. Defenders have a finite amount of reinforcements and must use each wisely. Once the third objective is captured by the attackers, a fourth cache objective must be destroyed, while the defenders have only one life to make a last stand. Firefight --- Three territorial objectives, one for each team, plus one neutral. Each team only respawns when they secure an objective. Secure all objectives or eliminate all enemy to win. Every life counts, making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork. Skirmish --- In addition to three territorial objectives, each team has a supply cache to protect. Teams gain extra reinforcement waves until their cache is destroyed. When both teams have lost their caches and all reinforcement waves, it becomes a Firefight match. Occupy --- There is one central territorial objective in the area. The team that controls it does not deplete reinforcement waves. This gameplay in this mode is reminiscent to King of the Hill or 'tug of war'. Ambush --- A high value target ('HVT') must be escorted to an extraction point. It's one team's goal to make this happen and it's the other team's goal to stop this from happening at all costs. The HVT is only armed with a silenced pistol, but can pick up a weapon from a fallen enemy or teammate. Strike --- Three weapon caches must be destroyed by the attacking team to achieve victory. Destroying a cache earns the attackers more reinforcements and time on the clock. The defenders must retain at least one cache from being destroyed and eliminate the enemy team once their reinforcements run dry. Infiltrate --- The standard Capture the Flag mode, but with a twist. Your team's goal is to take the enemy's intel and return it to your base. Your team will only gain reinforcements when someone takes the enemy's intel, or when an enemy stealing your team's intel is neutralized. This mode requires very strong team coordination and strategy. Flashpoint --- One neutral territorial objective and two caches on each side. The goal is to secure the entire area, controlling the middle and destroying the enemy's caches. Your team respawns when they secure the territorial objective or destroy a cache objective. Elimination --- In this single life mode, attackers must destroy one of two weapon caches, or eliminate the enemy team within the time limit. Defenders must kill all attackers. Cooperative Game Modes Checkpoint --- Complete mission-based objectives in sequence against AI enemy. Each successful objective will respawn anyone who was eliminated along the way. Hunt --- Insurgents are dispersed in the environment, and your squad must eliminate all targets while locating and destroying the weapons cache. High on tension, with only one-life. Survival --- Play as Insurgents and fight against endless waves of progressively difficult Security enemies on night themed maps. Reaching safehouse objectives with your team earns you supply to purchase better weapons and spawns any dead teammates. Outpost --- Defend your supply cache against endless waves of enemy trying to destroy it. Each successfully defended wave will bring in reinforcements of your teammates. Conquer --- Capture the objectives in the area and defend them from enemy trying to retake them. Destroy enemy weapon caches to thin out their numbers.;Take to the streets for intense close quarters combat, where a team's survival depends upon securing crucial strongholds and destroying enemy supply in this multiplayer and cooperative Source Engine based experience.

For each objective captured, they gain more reinforcement and time to attack the next. Defenders have a finite amount of reinforcements and must use each wisely. Once the third objective is captured by the attackers, a fourth cache objective must be destroyed, while the defenders have only one life to make a last stand. Firefight --- Three territorial objectives, one for each team, plus one neutral. Each team only respawns when they secure an objective. Secure all objectives or eliminate all enemy to win. Every life counts, making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork. Skirmish --- In addition to three territorial objectives, each team has a supply cache to protect. Teams gain extra reinforcement waves until their cache is destroyed. When both teams have lost their caches and all reinforcement waves, it becomes a Firefight match. Occupy --- There is one central territorial objective in the area. The team that controls it does not deplete reinforcement waves. This gameplay in this mode is reminiscent to King of the Hill or 'tug of war'. Ambush --- A high value target ('HVT') must be escorted to an extraction point. It's one team's goal to make this happen and it's the other team's goal to stop this from happening at all costs. The HVT is only armed with a silenced pistol, but can pick up a weapon from a fallen enemy or teammate. Strike --- Three weapon caches must be destroyed by the attacking team to achieve victory. Destroying a cache earns the attackers more reinforcements and time on the clock. The defenders must retain at least one cache from being destroyed and eliminate the enemy team once their reinforcements run dry. Infiltrate --- The standard Capture the Flag mode, but with a twist. Your team's goal is to take the enemy's intel and return it to your base. Your team will only gain reinforcements when someone takes the enemy's intel, or when an enemy stealing your team's intel is neutralized. This mode requires very strong team coordination and strategy. Flashpoint --- One neutral territorial objective and two caches on each side. The goal is to secure the entire area, controlling the middle and destroying the enemy's caches. Your team respawns when they secure the territorial objective or destroy a cache objective. Elimination --- In this single life mode, attackers must destroy one of two weapon caches, or eliminate the enemy team within the time limit. Defenders must kill all attackers. Cooperative Game Modes Checkpoint --- Complete mission-based objectives in sequence against AI enemy. Each successful objective will respawn anyone who was eliminated along the way. Hunt --- Insurgents are dispersed in the environment, and your squad must eliminate all targets while locating and destroying the weapons cache. High on tension, with only one-life. Survival --- Play as Insurgents and fight against endless waves of progressively difficult Security enemies on night themed maps. Reaching safehouse objectives with your team earns you supply to purchase better weapons and spawns any dead teammates. Outpost --- Defend your supply cache against endless waves of enemy trying to destroy it. Each successfully defended wave will bring in reinforcements of your teammates. Conquer --- Capture the objectives in the area and defend them from enemy trying to retake them. Destroy enemy weapon caches to thin out their numbers.;Take to the streets for intense close quarters combat, where a team's survival depends upon securing crucial strongholds and destroying enemy supply in this multiplayer and cooperative Source Engine based experience.;‚ÄúThis game has me hooked and I see it as a proudly raised middle finger in the face of large developers who seem to completely ignore fairness and player equality in favour of potential income.‚Äù 9.0 ‚Äì Hooked Gamers ‚ÄúInsurgency is going to win fans for its gameplay.

Choose from four unique, varied factions and wage war your way ‚Äì mounting a campaign of conquest to save or destroy a vast and vivid fantasy world. This is a game of two halves ‚Äì one a turn-based open-world campaign, and the other intense, tactical real-time battles across the fantastical landscapes of the New World. Play how you choose ‚Äì delve into a deep engrossing campaign, experience unlimited replayability and challenge the world in multiplayer with a custom army of your favourite units. Total War: WARHAMMER II offers hundreds of hours of gameplay and no two games are the same. World-Spanning Conquest Engage in statecraft, diplomacy, exploration and build your empire, turn by turn. Capture, build and manage teeming settlements and recruit vast armies. Level up Legendary Lords and Heroes and arm them with mythical weapons and armour. Negotiate alliances or declare Total War to subjugate any that stand between you and your goal. Epic Real-Time Battles Command thousands-strong legions of soldiers in intense tactical battles. Send forth ferocious, twisted monsters, fire-breathing dragons and harness powerful magic. Utilise military strategies, lay ambushes, or use brute force to turn the tide of combat and lead your forces to victory. The second in a trilogy and sequel to the award-winning Total War: WARHAMMER, Total War: WARHAMMER II brings players a breath-taking new narrative campaign, set across the vast continents of Lustria, Ulthuan, Naggaroth and the Southlands. The Great Vortex Campaign builds pace to culminate in a definitive and climactic endgame, an experience unlike any other Total War title to date. Playing as one of 8 Legendary Lords across 4 iconic races from the world of Warhammer Fantasy Battles, players must succeed in performing a series of powerful arcane rituals in order to stabilise or disrupt The Great Vortex, while foiling the progress of the other races. Each Legendary Lord has a unique geographical starting position, and each race offers a distinctive new playstyle with unique campaign mechanics, narrative, methods of war, armies, monsters, Lores of Magic, legendary characters, and staggering new battlefield army abilities. Shortly after launch, owners of both the original game and Total War‚Ñ¢ WARHAMMER II will gain access to the colossal third campaign. Exploring a single open-world epic map covering the Old World and the New World, players may embark on monumental campaigns as any owned Race from both titles. Conquer the world, together Each of the Races in Total War‚Ñ¢ WARHAMMER II will be playable in single and multiplayer campaign, plus custom and multiplayer battles. As the two Legendary Lords for each race all have their own unique campaign start positions, you‚Äôll be able to play a 2-player co-op campaign as the same race. If you own both parts 1 and 2, you‚Äôll be able to play in multiplayer as any of the races you own. The World of Total War: WARHAMMER II Millennia ago, besieged by a Chaos invasion, a conclave of High Elf mages forged a vast, arcane vortex. Its purpose was to draw the Winds of Magic from the world as a sinkhole drains an ocean, and blast the Daemonic hordes back to the Realm of Chaos. Now the Great Vortex falters, and the world again stands at the brink of ruin. Powerful forces move to heal the maelstrom and avert catastrophe. Yet others seek to harness its terrible energies for their own bitter purpose. The race is on, and the very fate of the world will lie in the hands of the victor. Prince Tyrion, Defender of Ulthuan, guides the High Elves in their desperate efforts to stabilise the vortex as it roils above their home continent. Atop his palanquin-throne, the Slann Mage-Priest Mazdamundi directs his Lizardmen war-hosts as they surge northward from Lustria. He, too, is intent on preventing cataclysm, though the methods of The Old Ones must prevail. The Witch King Malekith and his sadistic Dark Elf hordes spew forth from Naggaroth and their labyrinthine Black Arks. He tastes great weakness in the vortex ‚Äì and great opportunity in its demise. Meanwhile the Skaven, led by Queek Headtaker, stir in their foetid subterranean tunnels. There they multiply unchecked and look hungrily towards the surface, their motives obscured. The time for revelation is nigh‚Ä¶ Four races, four outcomes, a single goal: control of the Great Vortex, for good or ill. ;DEFEND YOUR WORLD. DESTROY THEIRS.

376210;The Isle;01.12.2015;0;19.99;0;"The Isle: A World Designed to Kill You The Isle is intended to be a gritty, open-world survival horror game. Explore vast landscapes of dense forest and open plains, traverse treacherous mountains and wade through dark swamps where horrors lurk. Hidden within are ruins that hold insight as to what came before. Through it all, keep in mind there is only one goal: survive. There is little in the way of hand holding or ulterior precepts to alter play styles or purpose. It's kill or be killed. In the end, the only one you can trust is yourself. Over the course of development the islands and their inhabitants will radically change, ever-evolving as players themselves learn how to flourish and thrive. Your mistakes will be punished. Expect no survivors. Massive Prehistoric Multiplayer Become the beast within. When joining The Isle, you can play as one of dozens of unique creatures, from tiny darting herbivores like Dryosaurus to blood-thirsty giants such as T. Rex or Allosaurus (with many more still to come!) As a dinosaur, you'll be the epitome of majestic, cunning and ferocious. Use your natural abilities and senses to stay off the menu and grow into a stronger, more capable creature. Engage with a living prehistoric ecosystem as you become either predator or prey on servers featuring up to 100+ players, all of them as hungry and dangerous as you. Form packs/herds, create nests, defend your offspring, hunt, and claim territory. A single mistake can spell your demise. Survival or Sandbox? The Isle's core game mode is Survival, a tense and difficult experience where you need to grow fast or die young. Dinosaurs in Survival mode progress through several life stages, starting out small and vulnerable. Use your scent ability, night vision and wits to survive long enough to grow, becoming more powerful and unlock new abilities such as nesting. Because of the time needed to develop a full character life cycle, not every creature is or will be playable in Survival, though more will be added in future updates. However, sometimes you don't want to struggle to survive, or you don't have the time to go through a dinosaur's whole life story. And that's okay. For players who want a less intense experience, Sandbox mode lets you play an expanded roster of dinosaurs (and soon humans!). You can jump right in as an adult super predator or a peaceful giant, with no major penalties or consequences from dying. We won't judge. A Global Community Story The Isle features a narrative told strictly through the environment, achievable only through immense cooperation among players. Are you stranded? Can you just leave? What is AE? How did the dinosaurs get here? What is the distant call that pierces the night? It will take the entire community to answer these mysteries and unravel the purpose to their being on The Isle, and each discovery will directly affect the future of the game's storyline. Future Development Goals We realize that there is a long road ahead, and a lot of work to be done to turn this into the game we want it to be. Throughout development, we will be adding a lot more to The Isle and incorporating user feedback in how we evolve the experience. Some of our planned features include: Playable aquatic and aerial creatures Even more playable dinosaurs with complete life cycles Two new playable factions: modern humans &amp; the indigenous Evolve into advanced 'strain' versions of certain dinosaurs Realistic dinosaur AI that uses complex behaviours Additional world biome types such as thick jungles Dynamic aerial drop-in spawn system Global in-game world quest Localization of all in-game menus &amp; text Better accessibility &amp; customization options Steam Achievements, Trading Cards, Emotes Mod support using Steam Workshop All that and more are on our radar going forward. We started with a plan of just a mere handful of playable carnivores, but based on player demand we expanded our scope, increased that number greatly and introduced herbivorous dinosaurs as well. Listening to our community has been instrumental in guiding our process and helped to correct our mistakes, and we hope that together we can transform The Isle into the ultimate dinosaur game. --AE Core TX Received-- --End Promotional Protocol-- --SiGnaL InTeRrUpt-- -tHEeNdISnevErTheENDisNeVeRtHeEnDIsNev -";"The Isle: A World Designed to Kill You The Isle is intended to be a gritty, open-world survival horror game.

About the Game In KILLING FLOOR 2, players descend into continental Europe where the outbreak caused by Horzine Biotech‚Äôs failed experiment has quickly spread and gained unstoppable momentum, essentially paralyzing the European Union‚Äî Just one month after the events in the original KILLING FLOOR, the specimen clones are everywhere and civilization is in disarray; communications have failed, governments have collapsed, and military forces have been systematically eradicated. The people of Europe know survival and self-preservation too well and lucky survivors have gone into hiding. Not all have given up hope though... A group of civilians and mercenaries have banded together to combat the outbreak and established privately funded operation bases across Europe. Upon tracking specimen clone outbreaks, players will descend into zed-laden hot zones and exterminate them. KEY FEATURES: ‚Ä¢ Visceral Gore - KILLING FLOOR 2 ramps up the gore with a proprietary, high powered persistent blood system bringing new levels of fidelity to the genre. Players will send entrails, severed limbs, and blood flying as they wade through hordes of enemies. But they need to watch out! If caught, enemies will rip them, and their entire party limb from limb ‚Ä¢ 6 player co-op or solo play‚Äî A multitude of varied playable characters await for players to choose from as they enter the fray in online co-op mode or solo mode for those willing to brave the horrific specimens alone ‚Ä¢ Versus Survival Game Mode - Be the Zed!

233860;Kenshi;06.12.2018;0;29.99;1;A free-roaming squad based RPG focusing on open-ended sandbox gameplay features rather than a linear story. Be a trader, a thief, a rebel, a warlord, an adventurer, a farmer, a slave, or just food for the cannibals. Research new equipment and craft new gear. Purchase and upgrade your own buildings to use as safe fortified havens when things go bad, or use them to start up a business. Aid or oppose the various factions in the world while striving for the strength and wealth necessary to simply survive in the harsh desert. Train your men up from puny victims to master warriors. Carry your wounded squad mates to safety and get them all home alive. FEATURES Freeform gameplay in a seamless game world in the largest single-player RPG world since Daggerfall, stretching over 870 square kilometers. The game will never seek to limit you or restrict your personal play style. Custom design as many characters as you want and build up a whole squad to fight for you. Characters will grow and become stronger with experience, not just in their stats but their appearance too. Build a base where you can research new technologies, upgrade your defences and craft new gear. Original take on the RTS-RPG hybrid genre. No 'hero' characters with artificially stronger stats than everybody else- Every character and NPC you meet is potentially an equal, and has a name, a life. You are not the chosen one. You're not great and powerful. You don't have more 'hitpoints' than everyone else. You are not the center of the universe, and you are not special. Unless you work for it. Purchase and upgrade your own buildings to use as safe fortified havens when things go bad, or use them to start up a business. Variation and possibilities of gameplay. Be good, be evil, be a businessman, be a thief, live in a town, live in the desert, travel alone, travel in hordes, build a fortress, raze a city. Devote yourself to freeing slaves, or maybe end up a slave yourself. Dynamic, ever changing world. Support or hinder whoever you wish, or keep to yourself, the world won't stop moving. This is not just a 'game', you are living and surviving in a simulated world. Get captured by cannibals and eaten alive , or sold off by slavers and forced to work in the mines. These are not scripted events, just a regular part of this chaotic world that ruins your life by chance. Anything can happen, yet anything can be overcome if you have the strength. Absolutely no Level-scaling. The world does not level up along with you, and the shops don't change their inventory to only items matching your level. At the start of the game almost everyone will be stronger than you, and survival will always be a struggle. The game won't hold your hand or help you when you're down. Realistic medical system that affects gameplay. A character with a wounded leg will limp or crawl and slow the party down, wounded arms means you must use your sword one-handed or not at all. Severe injuries will result in amputees needing robotic limb replacements. Blood loss means you can pass out, and the blood will attract predators. A character‚Äôs stats are affected by equipment, encumbrance, blood loss, injuries and starvation. Intelligent AI that allows for characters to reason and work towards long-term goals and desires. Squads work together and carry their wounded to safety. Characters can be setup to take care of micromanagement for you and run production in your base. Aid or oppose the various factions in the world while striving for the strength and wealth necessary to simply survive in the harsh environment. Independently developed with no design influences, or alterations dictated by men in gray suits who have never played a game before in their lives. Original game world.

1366540;Dyson Sphere Program;20.01.2021;0;19.99;2;New Content The mist envelops, veiling the radiance of the sun. As the dark fog consumes sector after sector, factories are destroyed. Even the stars lose their brilliance, dimming slowly, and everything succumbs to an eerie silence... Messages arrive from the distant cosmos, both unfamiliar and yet strangely familiar. ‚ÄúWarning...Upload power is insufficient...Seeking high-energy targets...Attempting self-replication... Anomaly... Replication exceeds limits... Warning... High-energy target detected!!!‚Äù Icarus, the CentreBrain has intercepted signals from an unstable energy source. They are approaching the sector you are in. Their characteristics match those of the mechanical bodies that previously destroyed COSMO factories, as known as Dark Fog. They likely have reached the nearby sectors. Be fully prepared, COSMO will provide you with the technology to defend against them, ensuring the smooth implementation of the Dyson Sphere Program. This update is the first part of the combat system, and there will be future content related to space combat. Building space stations and confronting space hives are already in our plans. About the Game Dyson Sphere Program is a sci-fi sandbox construction game with space, adventure, exploration and factory automation elements. In the future, humanity creates a supercomputer known as the 'CentreBrain' with the hope of utilizing its powerful computing capabilities to further expand the application of virtual worlds. You are a space engineer in charge of a project launched by the space alliance COSMO, tasked with a massive undertaking: constructing Dyson Spheres (a megastructure that would orbit around a star, harnessing all its power and energy) to produce the energy that CentreBrain needs. Each game features a unique and one-of-a-kind universe Start with a small workshop and improve it until it spans the whole galaxy Engage in battles, construct defensive structures to repel enemy attacks Explore a vast universe with various celestial bodies, including neutron stars, white dwarfs, red giants, and even black holes Automate production beyond planetary surfaces, transporting resources across star systems Develop your very own Dyson Spheres Perfectly show the constructions you've completed on a planet's surface Blueprint allows you to save important plans Customize the mecha to create unique designs and traverse the universe with your creation To construct a Dyson Sphere, you need to utilize automation. Start simple and gradually increase complexity. Maximize the stable output of resources through automated facilities. Connect resources with conveyor belts, transporting raw materials to processing facilities, and then conveying the products to the next stage. Progress from basic transport lines to elaborate plans for factories with diverse outputs. Utilize your production to drive technological advancements, meeting the necessary conditions for building the Dyson Sphere. During the construction, buildings will automatically snap to the grid. When laying conveyor belts, the use of snapping allows for automatic alignment, significantly improving efficiency. This enables the creation of large-scale automated production lines. The construction of the Dyson Sphere relies on vast and efficient factories. The convenient blueprint technology allows you to save your essential plans. You can save factory designs as blueprints and deploy them directly in other locations, eliminating the hassle of repetitive operations. You can construct Dyson Shells on multiple orbits, and each layer of the Dyson Shell can be customized. Connect various nodes on the Dyson Shell, creating the patterns you desire. Each Dyson Sphere is a unique masterpiece crafted by you. Each planet will have unique mineral distribution and ecological characteristics. Every time you enter the game, you can experience a randomly generated and entirely new starmap, with landscapes and resource deposits changing accordingly. Each planet has its own orbit, experiencing the gravitational effects of its star with rotation and revolution, resulting in day and night changes influenced by the star. In addition, there are unique celestial bodies such as neutron stars, white dwarfs, red giants, and even black holes, awaiting your exploration in this vast universe. The resources on a single planet might be insufficient for such an extensive project. You can harness the abundant resources of other planets. Overcoming the constraints of surface transport, establish your interstellar transportation routes. Interconnect planets with fleets of transport ships, tapping into the unique resources of each planet to ensure an uninterrupted supply of raw materials for your factories. Not only can you paint Icarus in your favorite colors, but you can also customize every component, creating your vision of a futuristic light industrial mech. The Dark Fog has arrived, resenting countless challenges to your factory construction endeavors. In addition to pursuing the goal of building the Dyson Sphere, you must also focus on defending your factories in Rise of the Dark Fog. The Dark Fog will do everything possible to hinder the progress of the 'Dyson Sphere Program,' with Icarus also being a target of their attacks. Be prepared! Don't rely solely on Icarus to face the overwhelming numbers of the Dark Fog. COSMO has devised contingency plans to assist you in repelling the attacks of the Dark Fog. While constructing factories, you'll need to deploy essential defense structures. The more active your operations, the more frequently the Dark Fog will launch fierce assaults. Utilize your defense facilities to unleash 'fireworks' and disperse the Dark Fog. We are Youthcat Studio from Chongqing, China. Starting as a team of five, we have grown steadily (though not excessively) as we journey alongside Dyson Sphere Program. Driven by our love for science fiction, we've created this game‚Äîtaking you from building the first mining machine to establishing automated factories across the cosmos.

224260;No More Room in Hell;31.10.2013;0;0.0;1;"CHECK OUT NMRIH2 Just Updated Now with Steam Workshop! Check out custom maps and download other modifications by the community. About the Game 'When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth.' A tribute to the highly acclaimed film series in which the above quote originated from, No More Room in Hell (PC Gamer's Mod of the Year 2011, ModDB's Editor Choice Multiplayer Mod of the Year 2011), is a co-operative realistic first person survival horror modification for the Source Engine. Taking inspiration from George Romero's 'Of the Dead' series, the mod is set during a time in which the world is on the verge of collapsing into chaos from a disease whose origin is unknown. Many experts and organizations have their theories and ideas on how such a disease emerged and started to systematically destroy our very way of life, but one fact is clear to all. Whoever perishes from the disease gets up and kills, and the people they killed get up and kill. The chances of you surviving this all out war of society and the undead are slim to none. Already, there are millions of the walking dead shambling about, searching for food to eat. There's no known cure. One bite can possibly end it all for you. However, you aren't alone in this nightmare. There are still a handful of uninfected survivors left in this god forsaken hellhole, and with co-operation and teamwork, you may live long enough to fight your way to salvation. Features: Teamwork: Co-operative play with up to eight players. Voice and Text Communications Limited by Distance: The further you're away the harder it is for other players to hear you. Keep those walkie talkies close! Dynamic Objective Maps: The next playthrough may not be the same as the last! Survival Mode: Defend and maintain your shelter against the undead in the hopes of getting extracted to a safe area. A Realistic Approach: In short, no crosshairs with limited 'only when you want it' HUD. In addition, ammo and weapons are extremely scarce. With that in mind, aim down your sights and shoot for the head! Multitude of Different Opponents: Ranging from the iconic 'walking zombie' to the more contemporary 'runners', NMRiH will keep you on your toes with a mix of dangerous foes to face down. However, the most dangerous enemy may not always be the walking dead... Infection: One bite may be what it takes to bring you down. If infected, you must decide if you want to alert your team to rid you of your burden, or to keep quiet in the hopes of finding a cure... 30+ weapons and counting, ranging from the diminutive .22 Target Pistol, to the almighty Chainsaw. No ads (on official and community official servers, user-hosted servers may vary) No pay to win items or microtransactions 100% Free (unless you buy the soundtrack DLC &lt;3) No More Room in Hell is a Half-Life 2 Zombification. The mod was founded in 2003. It switched hands and a new team took over in 2009. Beta version 1.0 was released on Halloween of 2011. A full list of the No More Room in Hell Team and contributors can be found on the about page of our website: .";"'When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth.'

1818450;STALCRAFT: X;09.12.2022;0;0.0;0;STALCRAFT: X is an exciting online MMOFPS game with Survival Horror elements. It combines open world, RPG and dynamic shooter. For more than 10 years, our team has been creating a unique living world of Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, that will give you new emotions and impressions. GAMEPLAY DESCRIPTION Dive into the world through an atypical for MMO cinematic non-linear storyline, which creates the feeling of passing single-player game in the stalker setting for dozens of hours. In the Zone, your choices always matter, and you'll be able to try on any role and find an activity to your taste: hunting for artefacts or players with artefacts, exploring territories and caches, trading, science, banditry, faction wars and a huge variety of other PvP and PvE activities. You'll also have your own hideout for resting and preparing for new raids, which you can equip with various furniture and useful structures for crafting. LIVING OPEN WORLD The world of STALCRAFT: X will truly surprise you. In addition to real players creating unique situations for each other, it is filled with NPCs and mutants living their normal lives, as well as factions fighting and trading with each other. The zone is not only dangerous, but also a very beautiful place ‚Äî various anomalies affect the view of the area and add a special charm to the post-apocalyptic world. At all locations you can be shot by players from another faction, but you will not lose your equipment and progress, but will lose most of the resources you've gained during your trip. Thanks to this, you will keep the thrill of each raid, and failures will not be fatal. UNIQUE COMBINATION OF FPS AND RPG GENRES The balance of weapons is not typical for open-world MMOs and is rather reminiscent of session shooters like Counter Strike and Call of Duty. We characterise the shooter component as fast-paced, tied primarily to shooting skills and terrain knowledge. Over the years, we have managed to combine FPS and RPG elements in a unique combination, which makes STALCRAFT: X special among other games of a similar genre. PROGRESSION AND OPEN ECONOMY Don't let the MMO genre scare you. There are no levels in our game, and development happens by obtaining new equipment in many ways, including buying it from other players. STALCRAFT: X has an open economy, where everyone can become a famous merchant without leaving the base! By the way, there are no wipes in our game ‚Äî this means that your progress will be saved forever and will not be deleted. DISTRIBUTION MODEL Our game is distributed for free, but monetisation is organised on a ‚ÄúPay for time‚Äù model. Any items can be obtained in-game, but the soft monetisation method allows you to speed up some areas of character progression or get cosmetic items. ;STALCRAFT: X is an exciting online MMOFPS game with Survival Horror elements.

881100;Noita;15.10.2020;0;19.99;1;Noita is a magical action roguelite set in a world where every pixel is physically simulated. Fight, explore, melt, burn, freeze and evaporate your way through the procedurally generated world using spells you've created yourself. Explore a variety of environments ranging from coal mines to freezing wastelands while delving deeper in search for unknown mysteries. Pixel-based physics: Every pixel in the world is simulated. Burn, explode or melt anything. Swim in the blood of your foes! Enter a simulated world that is more interactive than anything you've seen before. Your own magic: Combine spells to create your own magic as you delve deeper into the caverns. Use magic to crush your enemies and manipulate the world around you. Procedurally generated world: Explore a unique world every time you play. Discover new environments as you adventure deeper. Action roguelite: Death is permanent and always a looming threat. When you die, don‚Äôt despair, use what you‚Äôve learned to get further on your next adventure. Noita is being developed by Nolla Games, a company set up by 3 indie developers, all of whom have worked on their own projects in the past. The three gents in question are: Petri Purho Petri is best known as the creator of Crayon Physics Deluxe. In his youth he also made a lot tiny freeware games. He has also made a bunch of board games, but he hasn't told about it to anyone. So please keep it a secret. Olli Harjola Olli is known for the award-winning, mind-bending sci-fi puzzler The Swapper. Besides indie games, he also dabbles in music, live visuals and making programming languages. Arvi Teikari Arvi is also known as Hempuli. Over the years he has released a lot of tiny experimental games, so many in fact that he is unaware of all of them. One of the games he remembers making is Baba Is You.;Noita is a magical action roguelite set in a world where every pixel is physically simulated.

Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy is a punishing climbing game, a homage to Jazzuo's 2002 B-Game classic 'Sexy Hiking'. You move the hammer with the mouse, and that's all there is. With practice, you'll be able to jump, swing, climb and fly. Great mysteries and a wonderful reward await the master hikers who reach the top of the mountain. To quote Jazzuo himself: 'The hiking action is very similar to way you would do it in real life, remember that and you will do well'. Climb up an enormous mountain with nothing but a hammer and a pot. Listen as I make philosophical observations about the problem at hand. Between 2 and ‚àû hours of agonizing gameplay, depending. The median time to finish for my playtesters was 5 hours, but the mean was closer to ‚àû. Lose all your progress, over and over. Feel new types of frustration you didn't know you were capable of.

2016590;Dark and Darker;07.06.2024;17;0.0;1;Free to Play Version! The free version of Dark and Darker allows players to create one character and play Normal mode on all maps, complete quests, and build a stash of loot! Players who enjoy their time with the free version and want to experience everything the game has to offer can upgrade to the full version for 15 Redstone shards (equivalent to $30.00). The full version of the game includes access to the High-Roller mode, where players can equip their hard-earned gear to take on even more dangerous dungeons and increase the stakes. Players will also gain full access to the marketplace where they can trade with other adventurers, 9 total character slots, and the Shared Stash! We hope that this version will give players a chance to experience some of what Dark and Darker has to offer and to give players who have not played since the playtests a chance to see what's new before they dive into the full edition. Upgrade to Legendary Status! About the Game An Unforgiving Hardcore First-Person Fantasy Dungeon Adventure. Unfathomable fortunes await the brave and the foolish willing to delve into the devastated depths of an ancient citadel. Band together with your friends and use your courage, wits, and cunning to uncover mythical treasures, defeat gruesome monsters, while staying one step ahead of the other devious treasure-hunters. Once you‚Äôve plundered your riches, now comes the hard part, getting out alive. Find the hidden escape routes before the ever-expanding darkness reclaims your riches and your corpse to her irresistible hoard. Irresistibly Classic Dark and Darker aims to capture the wonder and awe of classic fantasy adventure games. We stand on the shoulders of giants and strive to pay respects to the traditions of the genre. We hearken back to the old worlds where danger lurks around each corner, but where courage and adventure are rewarded with untold riches. Choose a role, party up! Team up with friends and assemble a party to increase your chances of survival. Choose from a wide array of timeless fantasy roles and build the perfect three-person squad. Play as a brawny barbarian holding the frontlines while your sharp-eyed ranger friend fires arrows from afar and your merry bard sustains morale with a lively tune. Unforgivingly Hardcore Dark and Darker is a world of high risks and high returns. Explore a mystical underground fortress where the dangers are unrelenting and even the smallest misstep can result in death. Sound judgement reaps huge rewards, but death carries a heavy penalty with the loss of all your loot. A focus on First-Person Combat Dark and Darker strives for high immersion. Adventurers must use their eyes and ears like you would in the real world. Players must target, track, and aim against the countless challenges they encounter. We supply a wide array of close combat weapons that each have unique patterns to learn and master. Strikes to the head and back do critical damage. Knowing how to properly wield each weapon gives the player an edge to survive in this harsh world. Old Magic Magic is a powerful but unwieldy force in the world of Dark and Darker. Mastery requires long incantations, special skills, the right channeling equipment, and a tactical eye. Spells must be timed and aimed for maximum effect. For the magically uninclined, tinkering, knowledge of special equipment, and a little foresight can help level the field. Comfort in the Shadows The darkness is your friend in this unrelenting setting. Turn off lights and use the darkness to hide from foes or set up ambushes. If the tides of battles take a turn for the worse, blending into the darkness can lead to a stealthy retreat. Escape! Discover hidden portals to delve deeper and deeper underground and uncover the most hideous monsters and invaluable artifacts. All the riches you collect are for naught if you can‚Äôt make it out alive. Find a rare exit before the dark swarm comes to collect your soul.;An Unforgiving Hardcore First-Person Fantasy Dungeon Adventure.

2399830;ARK: Survival Ascended;25.10.2023;0;44.99;8;"Respawn into a new dinosaur survival experience beyond your wildest dreams‚Ä¶ as ARK is reimagined from the ground-up into the next-generation of videogame technology with Unreal Engine 5! You awake on a mysterious island, your senses overwhelmed by the blinding sunlight and brilliant colors bouncing off every surface around you, the azure waters of a verdant Island lapping at your bare feet. A deep roar echoes from the misty jungle, jolting you into action, and you stand up ‚Äì not afraid, but intrigued. Are you ready to form a tribe, tame and breed hundreds of species of dinosaurs and other primeval creatures, explore, craft, build, and fight your way to the top of the food-chain? Your new world awaits‚Ä¶ step through the looking-glass and join it! FEATURES ARK: Survival Ascended has completely recreated and redesigned the artwork and worlds of ARK to take advantage of the latest in videogame technology, Unreal Engine 5, using high-end graphics features such as fully dynamic Global Illumination (‚ÄúLumen‚Äù), so that light bounces realistically off of surfaces and provides realistic reflections, and advanced mesh streaming (‚ÄúNanite‚Äù) of hundreds of millions of triangles for extreme detail. Advanced new physics systems such as dynamic water so that every creature creates waves, ripples, splashes, and bubbles as they move through fluids, and fully interactive physical foliage where every blade of grass, bush, and tree reacts to characters, explosions, projectiles, and physics objects. Knock down a tree, and see it crash into other trees and disturb all the foliage on its way down to smacking into the grass below! Detect an enemy moving sneakily through the grass as it shifts and sways in response to their presence. Demolish a building and watch the pieces break apart realistically, interacting with the grass and water as they fall. ARK: Survival Ascended includes access to all of ARK‚Äôs worlds, including Scorched Earth, Aberration, Extinction, ARK Genesis Part 1, ARK Genesis Part 2, and more. The Island, Scorched Earth, Aberration and The Center are released now, Extinction will be released on December 16 , with the subsequent expansion worlds to be added at no additional cost on a regular basis. The definitive survival experience returns better than ever: design your Survivor, form a tribe, and tame, train, breed &amp; ride dinosaurs within a living ecosystem. Watch your food, water, temperature, and weather patterns. Slowly expand outwards as you harvest, build structures, farm crops, customize your visual designs, and proceed to explore to uncover the true nature of The Island and the worlds beyond. Thorough Quality of Life revamps in every area: redesigned User Interfaces, dynamic navigation for intelligent creature pathfinding, Wild Babies, Photo Mode, new Camera systems, new Map system, Tracking System, new Structures and Items, new Creatures, and much more. Cross-Platform Modding: Download &amp; play new custom content created by players, including new maps, creatures, items, and game modes, through a dedicated mod collection directly within the game! Enjoy an endless stream of new ARK content as the creativity and talent of the community is fully unleashed for the first time ever across gaming platforms! Cross-Platform Multiplayer: form your online tribe across different gaming platforms as you work together to survive and thrive on the ARK! Supports public online multiplayer for up to 70 players, private-session multiplayer for up to 8 players, and local split-screen for 2 players.

386180;Crossout;26.07.2017;0;0.0;36;Just Updated This update brings: a new event, the reworked blueprints tab with many changes, including the increased blueprints storage size, manual ordering of parts going offline when your generator gets destroyed, a new alternative mission for all types of armoured vehicles and many other features! Find out more on the official Crossout website! Update Notes How to link your Steam and Gaijin accounts If you previously played Crossout or have a Gaijin account, we recommend that you link your Steam and Gaijin accounts when you first start the game through Steam.If this is not done when you first start the game from Steam, then in the future you will not be able to link your accounts. We encourage you to sign up for a Gaijin account if you don't have one. This will allow you to continue to use all the additional features of the game. Here is a brief guide on how to link your Steam and Gaijin accounts Once you've launched the game, you will see these fields on your screen. To link the accounts, enter your Gaijin account data (e-mail and password), click 'Log in' and confirm that you want to link your accounts. If you haven't got a Gaijin account or if you choose not to link accounts, you can log into the game through the 'Sign in with Steam ID' button. But you will no longer be able to link your accounts in the future. Attention! If you failed to link accounts by mistake and entered the game only through Steam, but still want your accounts to be linked, we recommend that you do not make any in-game actions, especially in the market, and contact support. We will try to help you. If you previously played ‚ÄòWar Thunder‚Äô, then most likely your accounts are already linked. You can learn more about linking accounts at the Technical Support website. Please, pay attention that there are 2 guides available: How to link your Steam account to your email address (In case you've been playing using the game launcher) How to link your Gaijin-account to your Steam-account (in case you've been playing the game using Steam) About the Game Crossout ‚Äî is a postapocalyptic MMO action game where you can create a unique design for an armoured vehicle from dozens of parts and then drive it into multiplayer battles raging on land and in the skies alike. Key Features: Unique vehicles, crafted by the players using a wide range of available parts: from maneuverable buggies and armoured aircraft flying high in the sky to heavy rovers on tracks and antigravitational battle platforms. Complete freedom of creativity and millions of possible combinations: create vehicles of any shape using dozens of parts, wide variety of armour and weapons as well as support systems. Advanced damage model: destroy any part of an enemy machine and it will affect the vehicle's performance immediately. Huge arsenal of weapons: from chainsaws, drills and machine guns to missile launchers, drones and invisibility modules. Your own workshop: create new parts and auction them at the in-game marketplace. Trading options between players: almost every piece that you have gathered in the battle can be sold to other players. Choose your own battle strategy: you can play by yourself or find a clan, participate in battles and tournaments. The only thing that matters is the Survival and Victory! CROSSOUT - The Road to Apocalypse In 2027, a mysterious disease outbreak swept over the entire planet. Some died instantly, while others experienced hallucinations and unbearable pain. The source of the disease, which journalists dubbed 'Crossout', and the mechanism of its development could not be determined. Within a few months, humanity was nearly wiped out. Only small groups of people were spared by Crossout, but it forced them to fight for survival in the desolate Wasteland. The survivors began to gradually change, and after about fifteen years, these changes affected their appearance as well. But the core qualities of people remained unchanged: peace among them was impossible. The armoured vehicles, originally built for survival, became increasingly armed. People formed factions, each with their own unique knowledge, technologies and perspectives. Some of them strive to rebuild the old world, but for others the world is synonymous with chaos and destruction. But this fragile balance was shaken when the survivors encountered mysterious robots known as the Ravagers, which can erase memories.;Crossout ‚Äî is a postapocalyptic MMO action game where you can create a unique design for an armoured vehicle from dozens of parts and then drive it into multiplayer battles raging on land and in the skies alike.

Rescued by Grand Inquisitor Heimlock, you were drafted into the Republic‚Äôs Army of the Purifiers at a very young age to be trained in the military academy and become perfect soldiers against the supernatural. You also had the chance to benefit from Heimlock‚Äôs occasional advice and training, which led you and your childhood friends, Valeria and Edric, to be called the ‚ÄúChildren of Heimlock‚Äù. Recently, the Brotherhood of Dawn has infiltrated the Crimson Keep, a mysterious republican fortress lost among the northern deserts known as the Red wastes. While the purpose of the attack was unclear, the republican Senate voted a retaliation act against all known locations of the Brotherhood. Led by Grand Inquisitor Heimlock himself, troops are soon deployed on the Coast of wrecks, near the city state of Stormfall, to terminate a camp of Brothers. You are, with your two childhood friends, part of operation Dawnbane, under the supervision of Justicar Ma√´lys. Key features: Free character development Wield a great variety of weapons and find your own playstyle thanks to their unique stances and combos. In Wolcen, there is no class, only your weapons set the rules for your skills types. Three types of resources Rage and Willpower interact with each other, using the Resource Opposition System. Stamina allows you to use a dodge-roll to avoid danger or travel faster. Item diversity Gear up according to your offensive and defensive choices with common, magical, rare and legendary items. Break the rules and unlock new possibilities with Unique items and rare affixes. Rotative Passive Skill Tree Make your own path throughout the 21 sub-class sections available in the Gate of Fates to customize your passives and make them fit to your play style. Skill customization Level up your skills with your character or alternative resources to gain modifier points and create your own unique combination of skill modifiers. Change your damage type, add new functionalities, grant buffs or debuffs, change the skill‚Äôs mechanics completely. The options are limitless. Strategic fights Wolcen‚Äôs creatures have complex patterns including deadly skills. Pay attention to various markers and to animation anticipation to avoid lethal attacks using your dodge roll ability. Aspects of Apocalypse All characters can shapeshift into one of the 4 Celestial incarnations available, each of them offering 4 different skills, and one devastating ultimate. Endless replayability Improve your gear by looting or crafting, gather resources to unlock rare missions, face advanced challenges for special rewards, experiment new builds, become the greatest achiever. There is always something to do in Wolcen: LoM. A taste for beauty Using the Cryengine technology makes Wolcen an immersive and beautiful game with highly detailed armors and weapons. In addition, 8 hours of epic orchestral music will accompany you during your journey. Unleash your fashion sense Customize your appearance by switching the visuals of your armors and weapons. Loot more than 100 different dyes and tune up your armor to have your very own unique style. The asymmetric armor system will also allow you to change your appearance for left and right shoulder and glove.

In short words - that means you can now experience lots of never-seen-before playthroughs and struggle with new challenges. Main changes: Remastered versions of all the classic locations One new classic scenario and a brand-new character New quests and locations added to the original game Vanilla version of the game ABOUT THIS WAR OF MINE: In This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. The pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive. Make life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival.

No. Is it a game anyone with a beating heart should play? Yes. A million times yes. It's a longform exercise in empathy, a sobering piece of work that fills in the blanks left when all we see of war are the headshots. It's a much-needed course correct in the current shoot-first-ask-questions-never gaming landscape that supposes war is won because one supreme badguy caught a bullet through his brainstem. No: It's won when the people who lived under his boot get to go home.‚Äù 8 ‚Äì Gamespot ;https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/282070/header.jpg?t=1741346423;http://www.thiswarofmine.com;http://forum.11bitstudios.com/;support@11bitstudios.com;PRAWDA;PRAWDA;PRAWDA;83;https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/this-war-of-mine?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f;59;84375;;['English', 'French', 'German', 'Polish', 'Russian', 'Italian', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'Turkish', 'Simplified Chinese'];['English', 'Simplified Chinese'];[{'title': 'Buy This War of Mine', 'description': '', 'subs': [{'text': 'This War of Mine - $19.99', 'description': '', 'price': 19.99}]}];['11 bit studios'];['11 bit studios'];['Single-player', 'Steam Achievements', 'Steam Trading Cards', 'Steam Workshop', 'Partial Controller Support', 'Steam Cloud', 'Family Sharing'];['Adventure', 'Indie', 'Simulation'];['https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/282070/ss_9a8e8724d4bc5a1ffc25b5aa52ed0400a856db6b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1741346423', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/282070/ss_2aebf3f26978369655c9d4316e627b084fa0a69e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1741346423', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/282070/ss_b65e44e1c5aa6ac2ea2d2b8f0eb94ff55c3cbd75.1920x1080.jpg?t=1741346423', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/282070/ss_60caf1baf885322cd45c0f6a84a19b112316b04f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1741346423', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/282070/ss_35f5bbc7b4bcdf0f48c93d055705594ea4749336.1920x1080.jpg?t=1741346423', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/282070/ss_69d59279fc6ac19a5c30a8209d753b1e8728fa40.1920x1080.jpg?t=1741346423', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/282070/ss_d17fe787849891db9b1c7f5c0d1eb079affc6f0f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1741346423', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/282070/ss_64243910e65df2963f953baa9d6056283205ea6f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1741346423', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/282070/ss_03f1ffbb3b36999da7ab1305c4a2b6f54b057478.1920x1080.jpg?t=1741346423', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/282070/ss_095feca4f334b0740d52bb3a58fca6d7c624265e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1741346423', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/282070/ss_28b7b1cd18ad4d4be25fef898a359445c0fcc9b2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1741346423', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/282070/ss_93b1ffea395ccc8d6f16dbd5d003efbb66f2f04e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1741346423'];['http://video.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_trailers/256864956/movie_max.mp4?t=1685354286', 'http://video.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_trailers/256767262/movie_max.mp4?t=1685354291', 'http://video.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_trailers/2032375/movie_max.mp4?t=1685354295'];0;;93611;7180;2000000 - 5000000;690;0;269;0;0;1362;{'Survival': 2829, 'War': 1515, 'Atmospheric': 1325, 'Singleplayer': 1230, 'Strategy': 1213, 'Choices Matter': 1066, 'Simulation': 1044, 'Crafting': 979, 'Base-Building': 969, 'Resource Management': 920, 'Post-apocalyptic': 814, 'Management': 805, 'Story Rich': 801, 'Indie': 772, 'Emotional': 757, 'Realistic': 743, '2.5D': 715, 'Psychological': 712, 'Drama': 710, 'Stealth': 704};94;60446;-1;-1

1363080;Manor Lords;26.04.2024;0;39.99;0;Manor Lords is a strategy game that allows you to experience the life of a medieval lord. Grow your starting village into a bustling city, manage resources and production chains, and expand your lands through conquest. Inspired by the art and architecture of late 14th century Franconia, Manor Lords prioritizes historical accuracy wherever possible, using it to inform gameplay mechanics and visuals alike. Common medieval tropes are avoided in favor of historical accuracy in order to make the world feel more authentic, colorful, and believable. Manor Lords provides a gridless city-building experience with full freedom of placement and rotation. Building mechanics are inspired by the growth of real medieval towns and villages, where major trade routes and the landscape influenced how settlements formed and developed. Spreading outward from a central marketplace, build your residential, commercial, and industrial districts following the natural lay of the land. Establish farms based on soil fertility, position hunting grounds according to animal populations, and ensure access to adequate resource deposits and forests to provide the raw materials needed for growth. Assign areas for housing and watch your residents build their homes in accordance with the historical burgage plot system. Each area will be subdivided based on your roads and the allotted space, and homes will scale accordingly. Build extensions behind larger homes to generate resources that would not otherwise be available. Homeowners don't just pay taxes ‚Äì they grow vegetables, raise chickens and goats, and otherwise supply themselves and other townsfolk with essential needs beyond what your managed farms, pastures, and industries can provide. Guide your settlements through the unique demands and opportunities of each season, enjoying the bounty brought by spring rains and preparing for the harsh snows of winter. From boots to barley and hides to honey, Manor Lords features a great variety of goods fitting of the era. Materials need to be transported and processed into finished products through production chains, and you must balance the basic needs of your people against the desire to produce luxury items to ensure happiness, manufacture trade goods for export, or forge arms and armor to aid in your conquests. Resources are littered across the map, encouraging you to expand and establish multiple specialized settlements. Extract valuable ores from your mining colonies, while villages devoted to agriculture, herding, or hunting supply the grains and meats needed to feed your growing populations. Will you spend your hard-earned influence to first acquire a rich source of iron for your smiths, or will you prioritize regions with fertile soil to serve as your breadbasket? Unchecked expansion will have a direct effect on the environment. Herds of deer will migrate away from encroaching civilization, lack of crop rotation will worsen soil fertility, and cutting down too many trees will result in deforestation. Establish trade routes and sell surplus goods to traveling merchants to enrich your population. Manufacturing and exporting a variety of goods will provide wealth with which to upgrade your peoples‚Äô homes, import goods you can‚Äôt produce yourself, and through taxes on said wealth, fill your own coffers. Yours is but a small parcel of land in a vast territory, and the competing ambitions between you and rival lords will inevitably lead to conflict. Lead your people into battle, not as expendable units to be easily replenished, but as your beloved loyal subjects where every death is a cost worth considering. Train a retinue of skilled warriors to fight battles alongside the levies you raise from the town militia. At times these soldiers will be needed to suppress banditry, and at other times you will lead your men into battle to conquer or defend territory. When needed, mercenaries are a costly option to bolster your ranks. Will you raise the militia at the first sign of trouble, bringing your economy to a stand-still as your peasants pick up arms and rush to form ranks, or will you spend your personal wealth to hire bands of sellswords instead? Command real-time tactical battles, taking into consideration fatigue, weather conditions, and equipment. Position your troops wisely ‚Äì a smaller force can defeat a larger enemy, if commanded well. Feel the cost of battle, even in victory, as each fallen soldier represents a lost person from your city. This game is a passion project started by a solo developer . You can reach out to me and share your opinions, ideas, and criticisms - I listen to your feedback .;Manor Lords is a strategy game that allows you to experience the life of a medieval lord.

To that end, we‚Äôve removed RADs from the game entirely. For those of you with RADs they have been converted to Credits, which can also be earned in-game. UPDATED CREDIT EARN RATE To make sure you guys earn whatever you want more quickly, we‚Äôve upped the Credit earn rates from 19 per minute to around 70 per minute, but this varies based on player performance. You'll find Credit Boosters in Advancement Crates to boost this rate. Players can also earn thousands of Credits by completing Contracts and getting their Daily Play Rewards.

1304930;The Outlast Trials;05.03.2024;0;39.99;3;Discord Channel About the Game Red Barrels invites you to experience mind-numbing terror, this time with friends. Whether you go through the trials alone or in teams, if you survive long enough and complete the therapy, Murkoff will happily let you leave‚Ä¶ but will you be the same? SYNOPSIS Set in the era of the Cold War, human guinea pigs are involuntarily recruited by the good folks at the Murkoff Corporation to test advanced methods of brainwashing and mind control. In a world of distrust, fear, and violence, your morals will be challenged, your endurance tested, and your sanity crushed. All in the name of progress, science, and profit. SURVIVE: SOLO OR COOP You‚Äôre all prisoners of Murkoff trapped inside their facility. You can choose to complete the trials by yourself or you can tackle them in a team of 2, 3, or 4 players. Coop is never forced when it comes to mandatory objectives but working together can be highly beneficial. Whatever the number of players in your party, it‚Äôs about surviving and getting out. Ultimately, your goal is to complete Murkoff's therapy and earn the right to be released back into society. In order to do so, you must complete the Trials and the MK-Challenges. Trials are immersive story driven therapies that take a certain time to complete. Mk-Challenges are shorter therapies occurring in modified or redesigned section of an existing map. HIDE OR FLIGHT In pure Outlast fashion, the core gameplay involves avoiding enemies, hiding from them, and trying to run away. Murkoff will provide tools you can use to increase your stealth capabilities, create opportunities to flee, slow down enemies, and more. However, you will have to earn those tools and work hard to improve them. The tools will allow you to Stun enemies Blind them See through walls Heal yourself and people around you. Murkoff will ask you to perform disturbing tasks in each trials or mk-challenges. Only after completing those, will you be allowed to exit the Trials or the MK-Challenges. CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION Customize and create your own trial patient. Your cell is your home while you complete the therapy, you can decorate it however you wish. Choose your tools, upgrades, and perks to fit your playstyle. Meet the Denizens of Murkoff‚Äôs Sinyala Facility in The Outlast Trials. Each one of them will try and help you get through the Trials in one piece! Think you‚Äôll make it? INVESTIGATE You‚Äôve been abducted by the Murkoff Corporation to undergo unethical experiments that will modify your psyche and behavior throughout the Trials. Collect documents and items that will help prove Murkoff‚Äôs malpractice against its patients. The Process: Break the Self: Murkoff aims to break down the test subject‚Äôs fundamental beliefs. Aspects of self-identity are systematically attacked. Like boot camp or indoctrination, the goal is to force a person to purge themselves of anything held sacred or taboo, the things that limit their behavior. The constant assault on identity, guilt and self-betrayal eventually leads to them breaking down. Build the Self: It‚Äôs a bad cop, good cop principle. The rejection of the old ideology leaves a vacuum into which the new ideology can be introduced. As the antithesis of the old ideology, it forms a perfect attraction point as the person flees the old in search of a contrasting replacement. This progress is accelerated as the new ideology is portrayed as harmonious and ideally suited to the person's needs. Collegiality and calm replaces pain and punishment. Just at the point when the person is fearing annihilation of the self, they are offered a small kindness, a brief respite from the assault on their identity. Salvation: Faced with the stark contrast of the pain of the past with the rosy glow of the future that the new ideology presents, the person sheds any the final allegiance to the old ideology, confessing any remaining deep secrets, and takes on the full mantle of the new ideology. This often feels, and has been described by many, as a form of rebirth. It may be accompanied by rites of passage as the person is accepted and cemented into the new order. The rituals will typically include strong statements made by the person about accepting the new ideology fully and completely, swearing allegiance to its leaders. Saluting flags, kissing other artefacts and other symbolic acts, all solemnly performed, all anchor them firmly in the new ground. Content and Photosensitivity Warning: The Outlast Trials contain strobing and flashing lights that could cause a small percentage of people to experience seizures when exposed to certain lights, patterns, or images. This game also contains intense violence, gore, graphic sexual content, and strong language. Please enjoy.;Red Barrels invites you to experience mind-numbing terror, this time with friends.

Available on Steam for the first time, this edition is packed with new and remastered content for the ultimate zombie survival experience. Join over 10 million existing players and discover what Juggernaut Edition has to offer: The base game plus all three add-on packs released to date, including the all-new Homecoming update: ‚Ä¢ Homecoming : a full-size, fully remastered, open world version of Trumbull Valley for the core game, reintegrating the Mount Tanner and Fairfield regions to the map, and adding new sites to scavenge, along with new sights to behold. ‚Ä¢ Heartland : an massive story campaign set in a familiar town with new challenges ‚Ä¢ Daybreak Pack : a test of teamwork with siege-style, 'survive the horde' gameplay ‚Ä¢ Independence Pack : a celebration of history that blows up zombies... with fireworks! Remastered graphics and an upgraded engine featuring realistic fog effects An expanded soundtrack with hours of new thematic musical arrangements Providence Ridge: a brand-new open-world map full of forests, zombies, and mystery Two-handed heavy weapons with new melee combat moves to bust zombie heads A new introductory experience and improved controls to help you master the apocalypse ... and countless other improvements to the classic open-ended sandbox gameplay. About the Game State of Decay 2 is an open-world survival-fantasy game set just after the zombie apocalypse. Your small community of survivors seeks to rebuild a corner of civilization, and you get to make all the decisions about how that happens. You decide who to recruit to your team, where to settle your community, how to fortify and upgrade your base, and when it‚Äôs time to move to greener pastures. You select which survivor to bring along on a scavenging run for the food and ammo you need, and who you‚Äôll use to fight off the zombies attacking your base. You choose how you‚Äôll deal with other people who move into your town. Will you be friendly and welcoming... or will you aggressively defend your territory? Every player‚Äôs experience in the sandbox is unique. Each character in your community has their own special set of skills and traits, so no two communities are ever the same. The challenges you face also vary from game to game, based on who you recruit and the decisions you make along the way. With co-op multiplayer support, you can visit your friends' communities and help them through a tough spot, bringing back rewards for your own communities later. Alternate game modes include a full 10-hour narrative campaign and a four-player zombie-slaughtering 'siege defense' mode. Undead Labs is proud to present our best-ever vision of the zombie apocalypse. Keep your eyes peeled and your weapons ready. This is one apocalypse you won't want to miss.

A seventh player controls the monster and is given only one goal: Find and kill everyone. Can you hear us? Welcome to your job as a Resource Extraction Specialist here at Playtime Co., the largest toy company in the world! You've been assigned to a special unit responsible for extracting giant toy parts from closed off areas of the factory. The parts are locked behind cryptic puzzles and guarded by freakish monsters that've taken over these once magical locations. Retrieve the parts, avoid any kind of contact with the monsters, and most importantly... don't die. Can you see this? Prepare yourself for a 6v1 battle of survival. Six players will take the role of a Survivor. Together, they must solve puzzles and forge together a toy of epic size, all while trying to stay alive. One player will take on the role of the Monster. There are several characters to choose from, all offering a unique set of skills used to catch and kill their prey. Give us a sign. ‚Ä¢ THE GRABPACK - Survivors wield a powerful tool known as the GrabPack. With two long, extendable arms, you can do most anything. Whether it be carrying a heavy object, grabbing something from far away, completing puzzles, or gripping doors to slam them shut in the face of the monster, the GrabPack is more than capable. ‚Ä¢ MANIC MONSTERS - As a monster, you have three distinct characters to choose from, each one a living, gargantuan monstrosity based off a Playtime Co. toy. Huggy Wuggy, Mommy Long Legs, and newcomer Boxy Boo all offer their own sets of abilities and unique styles of play. Whether you wish to be a manic brute with Huggy, quick and nimble with Mommy, or a springy hunter with Boxy, there's a monster to fit the bill. ‚Ä¢ SABOTAGE - Monsters will always want the element of surprise. Using Toy Tickets (Toy Tickets are an in-game currency that can only be earned by playing the game. You cannot purchase these tickets, there is no pay-to-win), you can purchase and upgrade new abilities called Sabotages. These allow you to get the jump on players. Use these to blind the survivors, boobytrap their path, destroy their GrabPacks, and so much more. ‚Ä¢ FEAR FACTORY - Playtime Co. is the king of the Toy manufacturing industry- and you're inside it. Explore two massive maps that feature many different sections of this crooked factory. A state-of-the-art theater with statues of fake gold, and a manufacturing area where toys are a'plenty. ‚Ä¢ BETTER &amp; STRONGER - Survivors won't be limited to any default abilities.

'Living' NPCs Thousands of NPCs, each with their own relationships and life experiences, will age, fall ill, and eventually die. You can form various kinds of relationships with them, even deciding their fate. You will marry and have children with your partner. You will cultivate and pass down your lifelong martial arts skills to the next heir. In the vast sea of people, you may even search for your lover from a past life. Meticulous Crafting Through gathering, crafting, repairing, and refining, you can use your own hands to forge any weapon or armor, and brew a variety of medicinal pills. Pick up a poisoned weapon, wear poisoned garments, and consume antidotes laced with poison. Authentic Martial Arts Combat A unique combat system that restores the design of 'countering moves,' 'using everything as a weapon,' and 'the longer the blade, the stronger the strike, the shorter the blade, the more dangerous the gap.' Every slash, sword strike, and palm will land on different parts of your enemy's body, creating a true-to-life combat experience. Combine your martial arts techniques, channel your inner Qi strength, and refine your skills and strategy. And there's much more, waiting for your discovery. ";'The Scroll of Taiwu' is an indie game themed around Chinese mythology and wuxia.

274190;Broforce;15.10.2015;0;14.99;1;"BROFORCE FOREVER Broforce Forever, the long-awaited free update to 2015‚Äôs most patriotic video game, held back from freedom-loving gamers for a crime it didn‚Äôt commit, has promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade and unleashes a megaton of Kentucky-fried carnage into the face of evil. The final update offers an improved and expanded campaign with new unlocks, along with six new ultra-patriotic bros, four new democracy-spreading challenge levels, and the ultimate expression of military might ‚Äì bug fixes! The best way for a returning player to enjoy this is to play through the entire campaign again. And again. Forever. NEW BROS Harness the calculating intelligence and acid-spitting allure of Seth Brondle, wield Xebro‚Äôs flying Chakram, serenade (and grenade) terrorism with the flamenco firebrand Desperabro, or become the thing monsters have nightmares about, a stake throwing, unholy purging, self-resurrecting teenage Slayer! If sniping is more your style, famed bug hunter Bro Gummer brings pinpoint liberation with his trusty rifle, while Demolition Bro‚Äôs Freeze Grenades put evildoers right back where they belong‚Ä¶ ON ICE. NEW BADDIES A Bro only becomes a force when confronted with those who seek to destroy their freedoms, and in Broforce Forever, the terrorists are even more determined to delete democracy. Motorbike Maniacs will try to run you down, while machine gun placements, barbed wire, sandbags and bazooka-laden blimps conspire to make each visit to occupied territory a very, very bad day at the broffice. NEW CHALLENGES Bros in search of even bigger battles can flex their muscles in new challenge levels known as Muscle Temples. Each campaign tasks Indiana Brones with navigating a perilous temple that features a new Threat Level and specific enemy types and hazards. Succeed and unlock one of four new flexes that can be deployed by any Bro, any time, any place. Just like freedom.

The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman. From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed! Can you survive five nights at Freddy's? 'For all the simplicity of the game‚Äôs controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‚Äòs is frightening. It‚Äôs a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying.

Set in the same universe as the first game, but with different characters and a different setting, Outlast 2 is a twisted new journey into the depths of the human mind and its dark secrets. Outlast 2 introduces you to Sullivan Knoth and his followers, who left our wicked world behind to give birth to Temple Gate, a town, deep in the wilderness and hidden from civilization. Knoth and his flock are preparing for the tribulations of the end of times and you‚Äôre right in the thick of it. You are Blake Langermann, a cameraman working with your wife, Lynn. The two of you are investigative journalists willing to take risks and dig deep to uncover the stories no one else will dare touch. You're following a trail of clues that started with the seemingly impossible murder of a pregnant woman known only as Jane Doe. The investigation has lead you miles into the Arizona desert, to a darkness so deep that no one could shed light upon it, and a corruption so profound that going mad may be the only sane thing to do.;Outlast 2 is the sequel to the acclaimed survival horror game Outlast.

In PAYDAY 3 the choice is put in the hands of the players, deciding how to tackle the heist, whether you sneak or go in guns blazing, whether you let your hostages go or keep them around as pawns, whether you go at it alone or bring friends. The choices are endless and in your hands, they will vastly change how the game plays. Not just anyone is worthy of standing at your side for something as important as a heist. Likewise, PAYDAY 3 is best enjoyed with close friends in mind, whether you bring them from your childhood or make them along the road. The PAYDAY-series has always valued the bonds made through hardship and tries to reflect that in the actions and words of our heisters while in the game, and through our community while on the outside.;PAYDAY 3 is the much anticipated sequel to one of the most popular co-op shooters ever. Since its release, PAYDAY-players have been reveling in the thrill of a perfectly planned and executed heist. That‚Äôs what makes PAYDAY a high-octane, co-op FPS experience without equal.;;https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1272080/header.jpg?t=1740490904;https://www.paydaythegame.com/payday3/;https://to.plaion.com/steamsupport;;PRAWDA;FA£SZ;FA£SZ;0;;22;43106;PAYDAY 3 contains repeated displays of gun violence, including the shooting of civilians and law enforcement.

We have created our custom engine to handle hordes of thousands of the infected, up to 20,000 units in real time. Do you think your colony is safe? Wait for the swarms of thousands of infected that are roaming the world. Sometimes your colony is in their path! Prevent the Infection If just one of the infected breaks into a building, all the colonies and workers inside will become infected. The infected workers will then run rabid to infect more buildings. Infections must be eradicated from the beginning, otherwise, it will grow exponentially becoming impossible to contain. Beautiful 4K Graphics! Prepare to enjoy these ultra high definition graphics. Our artists have created tons of art pieces: Beautiful buildings with their own animations, thousands of frames of animation to get the smoothest movements and everything with a crazy Steampunk and Victorian style!;They Are Billions is a Steampunk strategy game set on a post-apocalyptic planet. Build and defend colonies to survive against the billions of the infected that seek to annihilate the few remaining living humans.

Experience all the different crazy ups and downs and find out for yourself whether this story is even capable of having a happy ending. Turn ‚ÄúAme‚Äù ‚Äì somewhat of a hot mess of a girl ‚Äì into an OMGWTF-cute internet angel and jumpstart her career as a live streamer for the most hardcore nerds online! Ame: While she may look somewhat low-key and quiet, she‚Äôs actually a ridiculously selfish and vapid girl with a tendency to get carried away and a desperate need for approval. She‚Äôs, well... kind of troublesome personality. Likes: Her S.O./producer, ‚ÄúP-chan‚Äù; psychotropics. OMGkawaiiAngel: An ‚Äúinternet angel‚Äù. Ame‚Äôs alter ego, used while streaming. Pretends to be really nice and sweet. Constantly flirts with nerd types. P-chan: Gender, age, and all details are unknown. Or maybe it's you? ‚ñ†As Ame‚Äôs beloved (???) ‚ÄúP-chan‚Äù, offer daily commentary and guidance to help foster her into a top-tier streamer. Under your direction and guidance, she can amass more and more devoted listeners/obsessed fans, turning her into a super-popular streamer.‚Äì and thus allowing you to squeeze stupid amounts of Super Chat out of her donation-happy otaku followers. ‚ñ†Gotta get topics for streaming! Let's do all kinds of things from afternoon to evening to find out hot topics for streaming. Sometimes you just need to take a little break because streaming can be stressful. Take Ame on dates, serve her up a little bit of naughtiness once in awhile, provide her with a little something-something to take the edge off when she needs to release some pent-up stress, and use social media to grumble about to help keep her happy and mentally healthy. But be careful. Depending on your actions, she might increase her 'sickness level' and be swallowed by the darkness of the Internet! *NOTE: This is a perfectly wholesome game, containing absolutely no explicit sexual references or expressions nor illegal substances. For real! You can see the results of your daily actions and behavior via social media, where Ame-chan will use both public and private accounts to talk about you. People have a tendency to act supportive and friendly on the outside, while talking loads of smack and spreading rumors privately. ‚ñ†You'll get a variety of messages every day! Let's reply back to them with stickers. Ignoring messages is not a human thing to do. Don't make her angry. You‚Äôll sometimes receive long-winded, tedious criticisms and insults, but that‚Äôs just par for the course when dealing with a cute girl streaming on the internet. Be sure to take proper care of her. ‚ñ†The game features multiple endings! Your streamer will do things like become weird and emo for various reasons, subject her trusty P-chan to harm, and generally get messed up in the head. Begin your adventure and see for yourself whether a happy ending is really even possible for a cute yet disturbed girl on the modern-day internet. Let's Plays Welcome! We'd love to hear from you anytime at our official account!

493520;GTFO;09.12.2021;0;39.99;0;FINAL EDITION Rundown 8.0 ‚Äì Duality brings the story of the prisoners in the Complex to its riveting culmination. With all rundowns available in GTFO: Final Edition you and your team have more than 80 nail-biting challenges to suffer through. More than most people ever will be able to endure. About the Game Your team of prisoners is dropped into the Rundown when a new Work Order is issued by The Warden, the mysterious entity holding you captive. The Rundown is a series of expeditions, each one taking you deeper into a decayed research facility called The Complex. You descend level by level, scavenging tools and resources that help you survive in a perilous network of tunnels where gruesome creatures lurk in every shadow. Complete all the expeditions to fulfill the Work Order and clear the Rundown. GTFO is designed for prisoner teams of four, putting cooperation at the core of the experience. Bots can fill your lineup if you‚Äôre short one or two players. They‚Äôll follow you through expeditions, sneak when you sneak, collect resources, and fight alongside you. They‚Äôre a good fallback, but the level of communication and tactical combat in GTFO means it‚Äôs best to play with people. A strategy is necessary to clear the Rundown. Before you drop into The Complex, your team needs to decide what gear, boosters, and weapons to bring. You must also balance the team, identifying the function of each prisoner so that you know what to do when things go wrong. And they will. They always do. Stealth and coordination are necessary to survive as you maneuver through The Complex. Many of the creatures of GTFO are suspended in a state of hibernation, so light, noise, and vibrations can easily wake up these Sleepers. And if one of them knows you‚Äôre there, they all know. That‚Äôs when things get messy. You‚Äôll need heavy weaponry and a clear mind when the shit hits the fan. Check your line of fire, force them through bottlenecks, set up your kill zones and reload every chance you get. These creatures stop at nothing, and neither should you. Once the mayhem starts, you have no choice but to put every last one of them down. Clearing expeditions and Rundowns will reward you with new cosmetic gear. Wear it with pride, as it proves to your peers you‚Äôve been to hell and back. The Sleepers, on the other hand, will not care for a second. ;Your team of prisoners is dropped into the Rundown when a new Work Order is issued by The Warden, the mysterious entity holding you captive.

In this Complete Edition, including the game + Season Pass, access a new game mode, weapons, outfits and missions and plays as T-Bone, the legendary hacker in a brand new campaign!

But with that same simple swipe, we cast an increasingly expansive shadow. With each connection, we leave a digital trail that tracks our every move and milestone, our every like and dislike. And it‚Äôs not just people. Today, all major cities are networked. Urban infrastructures are monitored and controlled by complex operating systems.

This isn't your average pub ‚Äì it's a den of lies, deception, and mind games. Grab a seat at a table of four and immerse yourself in the ultimate first-person multiplayer online experience where cunning and trickery are the name of the game. Two Game Modes with Early Access Players take turns playing a card face down and declaring its value. The value should match the table‚Äôs value. (e.g., 'King' or 'Queen'). When a player lays down a card, they might be lying about its value. If you suspect a lie, you can call their bluff. If someone‚Äôs bluff is called and they were lying, they must play a round of Russian Roulette. Surviving one bullet out of 6 rounds of shells means you stay in the game; failing means game over for you. After Russian Roulette is played, the cards are reset, and the game continues. Roll your dice. No one can see your roll, but everyone‚Äôs watching your next move. On your turn, make a bid predicting the total number of dice on the table, showing a specific face (e.g., 'There are five 3‚Äôs'). The next player must either raise the bid by increasing the number of dice or the face value (e.g., 'There are six 4‚Äôs') or challenge the previous bid. Think someone‚Äôs lying? Challenge their bid! The loser drinks a bottle of poison. Drink two bottles, and you‚Äôre out! The last one alive wins!

Can you dig beneath the tough exterior to see what lies within? Foxy (the Gothic Vixen) A seductive gothic vixen with an enigmatic past, Foxy uses her charm and wit to outmaneuver her opponents. Will her allure be your downfall? Bristle (the Butcher Pig) Once a loving husband, this butcher pig now wears a haunting tattoo of his deceased wife on his chest. Driven by vengeance and guilt, can Bristle trust anyone, including himself? Toar (the Raging Bull) A raging bull with a temper as fierce as his loyalty is unwavering.
